The countless number of lives lost during World War II and the displacement of millions from their native lands are among the most tragic events in the history of the twentieth century. According to experts, the past century proved to be the most violent and the bloodiest one hundred years in human history, an assertion convincingly substantiated by scholars, researchers, and journalists who have published scores of books and articles about civilian and military victims of both world wars. Special emphasis has been put on victims of the Second World War, * The essay, which has been partly updated, has already been published on S. B. V\\\\u00e1rdy T.H. Tooley A. H.

She is the author, co-author, and co-editor of eight volumes and over eighty-five articles and essays, among them two books on Austro-German Romanticism, more specifically on two Romantic poets, Nikolaus Lenau and Karl Beck, and a social-historical novel, Mimi, used in history and literature courses at several American universities. A few years ago, along with her husband, Dr. Steven B. V\\\\u00e1rdy of the Dept. of History at Duquesne University, she began to do research on forced labor camps, known as the Gulag, in the former Soviet Union. Two of their books have already appeared on the subject: Stalin\\\\u2019s Gulag: the Hungarian Experience (Oriental University, Naples, 2007) pp. 203 and Magyarok a Gulag Rabszolgat\\\\u00e1boraiban [Hungarians in Gulag Slave Labor Agnes Husz\\\\u00e1r V\\\\u00e1rdy DEP n.7 / 2007 89 especially Hitler\\\\u2019s crusade against the Jewish population in the countries occupied by the Third Reich. Efforts to inform the general public about the horrors of the Jewish Holocaust have been especially successful and have led to widespread knowledge about these events among practically all the nations of the world. This level of historical awareness does not exist for most other ethnic groups and nationalities whose lives were adversely affected by World War II. Millions of non-Jews were forced to endure previously unheard of deprivation and hardship, before, during, and after the war. Compared to the extensive investigation of the Jewish Holocaust, historical research has paid little attention to the lot of other victimized groups. Relatively little has been written about them, and as a result, these events have failed to become common knowledge. The fate of those who fled their native lands in Eastern and Central Europe in fear of the invading Soviet Army, and later settled in Western Europe, or immigrated to North or South America, has not been adequately researched. Not much is known about the victims of forced population expulsions and ethnic cleansing, such as the sixteen million Germans who were expelled from Poland and Czechoslovakia (from former East and West Prussia, Pomerania, Silesia and the Sudetenland). In the same vein, with the exception of Hungarian scholars, the general public is not aware of the retribution suffered by about 120,000 ethnic Hungarians who were driven across the Danube from Slovakia to Hungary as a consequence of the Bene\\\\u0161 Decrees.

According to Barrel, originally 73.187 Hungarians were slated for expulsion on the basis of the parity list. An additional 106.398 were to be expelled as \\\\u201cmajor war criminals\\\\u201d and 1.927 as \\\\u201cminor war criminals\\\\u201d. Had this been implemented a total of 181.512 would have been expelled. But the Czechoslovak government was not satisfied even with these numbers. It turned to the Peace Conference and demanded approval for expulsion of an additional 200.000 Hungarians. These goals, however, were not allowed to be implemented, and thus by April 10, 1948, only 68.407 Hungarians were officially resettled in Hungary. Continued illegal expulsions, however, almost doubled this number, for according to the Hungarian census of 1949 at least 119.000 of these expellees were living in Hungary. Cf. I.

His victims included Poles, Ukrainians, Baltic peoples, Crimean Tatars, and many others who were exterminated by the millions. Yet, knowledge about the fate of these peoples is not widespread, at least not, to the extent to which the horrors of the Jewish Holocaust has permeated the historical consciousness of the broader public. It is evident that the victims of war and prejudice, misery, and extermination mentioned above have not attracted the same degree of interest of experts, researchers, and journalists. As a result, a gigantic gap of public ignorance and misinformation exists regarding these shocking events, both in Europe and the United States. The lives and fate of foreign victims of Soviet forced labour camps also falls into the category of \\\\u201cthe little known\\\\u201d. Insofar as historically aware individuals in Western Europe and North America have given the whole issue any thought, most have assumed that only POWs and members of the armed forces of the defeated nations were deported to the Soviet Union after World War II. This assumption could not be further from the truth. In the case of Hungary, it was only after the demise of Communism in 1989-1990 that researchers, journalists, and political leaders could begin to focus on the fate of the several hundred-thousand Hungarian civilians, including innocent women and children, who were deported to forced labour camps after the Soviet invasion of Hungary in September 1944. It is virtually impossible to uncover the full details about these deportations, but the publication of several studies based on memoirs, diaries, and interviews of survivors provides a vast amount of information that contributes substantially to our knowledge of these tragic events.

I examine how these short and long-term effects can extend into adulthood using an auto/biographical methodology; from a perspective influenced by my own encounters as a corporal punishment survivor from Nepal. \\\\n \\\\nCorporal punishment continues to be used in Nepalese schools, with the support of many teachers, parents and school management committees, despite several government policy initiatives and court rulings against it. In contrast to worldwide developments (notably in Scandinavia and America), research into corporal punishment in Nepal tends to be rare, quantitative and focused upon the prevalence and short-term effects as described by group participants and newspaper articles. This study addresses the urgent need to increase public awareness, using personal accounts describing the long-term outcomes of corporal punishment, with a depth of detail facilitated by an auto/biographical research methodology. Participants in the study expressed feelings of relief and increased self-understanding, although for myself at least, these were accompanied by feelings of grief and confusion. \\\\n \\\\nThe lives of five corporal punishment survivors are explored through a series of interviews carried out in the Devchuli municipality of Nawalparasi, Nepal, between November 2015 and January 2016. The first is my own story, the second is a pilot interview and the other three are discussed under the themes of immediate compliance, severing dichotomies, disempowered bodies and the spiritual threat of spatio-temporal appropriation. \\\\n \\\\nThe participants, whose identities are protected, look back, as adults, upon their experiences of corporal punishment at school and consider possible links between these and their current social, political, economic and spiritual challenges. Simultaneously, the study questions whether \\\\u2018effects\\\\u2019 can ever be conceptually or temporally contained within \\\\u2018multi-faceted\\\\u2019 and \\\\u2018becoming\\\\u2019 identities, using examples from the participants\\\\u2019 self-appraisals. \\\\n \\\\nI examine literature from the global debate on the effects of corporal punishment upon children, including the contrasting methodologies of Murray Straus, Alice Miller and Elizabeth Gershoff. The impact of corporal punishment upon notions of personhood is explored using Theodor Adorno\\\\u2019s interpretation of reification and comparable notions of objectification challenged by Andrea Dworkin, Martha Nussbaum and Paolo Freire. Corporal punishment is discussed in relation to power, conflict and the Holocaust, using Adorno and Bauman\\\\u2019s descriptions of authoritarian behaviours and immediate compliance, and Nietzsche and Foucault\\\\u2019s notions of punishment as a spectacle. Conditions for the possibility of corporal punishment are located to traditions deifying teachers, judgement-based belief systems and neo-liberal ideologies of competition and performativity. These are contrasted with alternative, non-punitive pedagogical and theological resources. Participants explore the ways in which healing and holistic self-development can be blocked by everyday vocabularies of violence and conditionality, triggering destructive individual and collective over-determined reactions. \\\\n \\\\nMy study \\\\u2018concludes\\\\u2019 with reflections upon how corporal punishment has affected my participants\\\\u2019 lives: with their social roles hampered by defensive masks and evasive dances; their political lives blocked by fears of punishment; their economic lives stilted by caution and low self-esteem and their spiritual lives distorted by disenchantment and disappointment. Methodology and theory converge as my study rejects inherently disciplinarian, Enlightenment-led demands fo**r rational or scientific \\\\u2018proof\\\\u2019 of psychological effects, by presenting auto/biography itself, especially \\\\u2018child-standpoint\\\\u2019 narratives, as valid revolutionary praxis, effervescent with resistance to punitive ideologies and practices and dedicated to the liberation of our present from a painful past.\", \"year\": 2017}, {\"paperId\": \"03af20b0f65018bc19dbb20b540e31455fb856e7\", \"title\": \"The Lifelong Process of Holocaust Survival: How Miriam Reich Rebuilt her Life\", \"abstract\": \"The overarching theme of this article is that the personal is historical and vice versa.

Overall, the findings contradict the traditional perception, in which the goal of therapy is defined as one of integrating the traumatic narrative with the entire life story.

It is less understood that due to their ethnic identity that approximately, 1. 9 million Polish Catholic citizens were murdered during the Holocaust and that 1.7 million Polish non-Jews were imprisoned in concentration camps in Siberia, 2.0 million were deported as forced laborers for the German Reich and 100,000 were killed in Auschwitz. To date, there are no studies within Western psychology that address the effects of the Holocaust for this population and/or their descendants. Given the known after-effects of Holocaust-related trauma for Jewish Holocaust survivors and their families, the trauma response observed in other genocide survivors, and the lack of psychological research aimed at exploring the experience of non-Jewish Holocaust survivors, there is a need to study the lived experience and effects of Holocaust-related trauma with Polish Catholic survivors and their families. This is an interpretative study that explores the lived experience of six Polish Catholic survivors and their descendants. The sample included 12 participants comprised of six survivors, four second generation and two third generation participants.

Fast (review)\", \"abstract\": \"A landmark moment in Holocaust history and memory occurred in 1989 when about 1,000 Kindertransport survivors attended their 50-year reunion in London. The event commemorated the transport of 10,000 children from Central Europe to safety in Britain. Launched on November 9, 1938, the transport continued for a year until the Nazis ended it when war was declared in September 1939. Before they began to share their memories of the transport, few had thought of themselves as Holocaust survivors. After all, they had escaped the round-ups and deportations that began shortly after November 9, 1938, when the Nazis orchestrated Kristallnacht (night of broken glass), the nation-wide pogrom against the Jews, their synagogues, and businesses. None of these child refugees had suffered the ghettoes or camps. They were not among the children who had been hidden with non-Jewish families or in convents, and they did not pass as Aryans with forged identity papers. And yet, as Vera Fast discovered in interviews, memoirs, and archives, despite being rescued, those 10,000 children did not escape the effects of the Holocaust. Almost all the children\\\\u2019s parents had been killed. For the younger children, this would mean that in addition to losing their parents, they would have no memory of them to mourn. For the older children, memories could be fleeting or remain as excruciating reminders of their loss. Of the few parents who survived, the trauma of separation was exacerbated when reunions were painful. However, despite these losses and pain, almost all of the Kinder grew up to have successful careers and rich personal lives, and they remained unequivocally grateful to the nation that saved them. Yet as memoirs and interviews reveal, their experiences were also complicated by the process of adapting linguistically and socially to an alien culture and society that did not always understand the emotional needs and religious customs of these Jewish children. Their story of rescue and adaptation is crucial to our knowledge of the Holocaust as it represents another facet of the intricate and global reach of Hitler\\\\u2019s designs to persecute and exterminate the Jewish people.\", \"year\": 2013}, {\"paperId\": \"09762167e502e1e1aa170f503aebd524198d02c3\", \"title\": \"Witness Theater: A Film Review Bridging the Generational Gap: Connecting Aging Trauma Survivors with Teens\", \"abstract\": \"ABSTRACT This film review examines the documentary Witness Theater directed by Oren Rudavsky.

New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004. 212 pp. $65.00 In recent years there has been a dramatic increase in publishing on the topic of children and the Holocaust. Scholarship has focused on the historical experiences of children during the Holocaust, the diaries they kept, the emotional legacy of child survivors, the retelling of their life stories, the treatment of the Holocaust in children\\'s literature, and more. My own book, Imaging the Child in Modern Jewish Fiction (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), highlighted writing by Jerzy Kosinski, Aharon Appelfeld, and David Grossman as I explored representations of consciousness and the depiction of children\\'s points of view in adult literary texts. That study drew on Bakhtin\\'s theories of the \\\\\"dialogic imagination,\\\\\" noting that polyphony is inescapable in texts that mediate children\\'s voices through adult narration or editing. In Children Writing the Holocaust, Sue Vice works with a similar set of assumptions and analytical tools to examine a wide range of authors and types of publications. She sets herself two main goals. The first is to identify a series of narrative features distinctive to texts, aimed at an adult readership, that deal with a child\\'s-eye view of the Holocaust. The second goal is to determine whether there is substantial literary material that treats the Holocaust from a child\\'s perspective. This book is at its finest in the skillful stylistic analyses it offers. Vice scrutinizes an impressive array of texts, bringing a sharp interpretive eye and nuanced readings to a variety of memoirs, autobiographical fictions, diaries, and more. Among the writers she considers are well-known figures such as Saul Friedlander (When Memory Comes) and Georges Perec (W or the Memory of Childhood), as well as numerous others who have received less recognition and critical attention. She discerns the following elements in much of this writing: \\\\\"Defamiliarization; errors of fact and perception; attention to detail at the expense of context; loss of affect; indefinite or divided temporality; irony of various kinds; the confusion of developmental with historical events; charged relations between author, narrator and protagonist; and age-specific concerns with the nature of writing and memory\\\\\" (p. 2). Relying on Bakhtin as her central theoretical model, Vice weighs how narrative strategies and narrative structures convey personal and historical trauma in this literary corpus. In the process she makes many good observations. Of note is the discussion of fragmentary narration, a kind of storytelling that combines detail with historical gaps. Of special interest, too, are diaries. As she rightly points out, this category of writing has, till now, received too little formal, stylistic analysis. A particularly fascinating topic is choral narration-a phenomenon found in fiction, biography, and autobiographical texts that express collective experiences. Examples cited here include Karen Gershon\\'s We Came as Children, a compilation of children\\'s remarks based on a series of interviews; Henryk Grynberg\\'s Children of Zion, an anthology of testimonies; and Clara Asscher-Pinkhoff\\'s Star Children, a collection of short stories. Vice is consistently excellent at teasing apart the components of narrative voice and pointing out ways in which Bakhtin\\'s ideas of dialogic discourse illuminate the literature at hand. Regrettably, for a study that focuses so intelligently on dialogics, Children Writing the Holocaust does not always engage adequately in dialogue with other scholarship. Vice is well versed in Holocaust studies, but her book does not deal sufficiently with work that takes parallel approaches to narratives of childhood and adolescence. She does not, for example, engage with my book, other than to list it in a bibliography. Had she been more in conversation with the ideas expressed there, she might have dealt more satisfactorily with the question of distinctiveness in the material she analyzes. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2006}, {\"paperId\": \"0d4c97305019a796b1bd885971518bb53e0e787b\", \"title\": \"Invited Talk: Lessons from the MALACH Project: Applying New Technologies to Improve Intellectual Access to Large Oral History Collections\", \"abstract\": \"In this talk I will describe the goals of the MALACH project (Multilingual Access to Large Spoken Archives) and our research results.

New York: Schocken Books, 2005. 274 pp. $25.00. On April 15, 1945, British tanks rumbled up to the barbed wire fence surrounding the concentration camp of Bergen-Belsen. The soldiers climbed out of their tanks, walked up to the wire, and peered through it. One by one, they began to vomit. The overpowering stench of countless corpses rotting in the sun, and the ghastly sight of skeletal survivors was an unimaginable experience even for these battle-hardened veterans. They were the first Allied eyewitnesses to what later became known as the Holocaust. After Daybreak is a vivid, gripping account of what happened after the British opened the gates of Bergen-Belsen. Never before had an army encountered such a catastrophic medical emergency. Bergen-Belsen was, in effect, a small city of 60,000 brutalized, starving, and typhus-ridden inhabitants. How the British doctors, nurses, medical students, clergymen, and other volunteers struggled to save the lives of the survivors is the focus of Ben Shephard\\'s superb book. Shephard is an Emmy Award-winning documentary filmmaker, the preeminent historian of military psychiatry, and the author of the magisterial A War of Nerves (Harvard University Press, 2001). Letters, diaries, interviews, and military documents provided Shephard with the raw material to reconstruct how the British coped with this unprecedented medical crisis in the days and weeks following the liberation of the camp. The story is one of trial, error, and eventual success. Approximately 14,000 inmates died after liberation, and about 2,000 perished after receiving food far too rich for them to digest. Medical personnel failed to realize that ravenous bodies adapted to starvation conditions cannot initially withstand a normal diet. One of the most heart-rending tasks was deciding who would get a chance to live and who would be left to die. Resources were limited, and not everyone could be saved. Nightly staff meetings, fortified by alcohol, kept the exhausted doctors sane and focused on their mission. After several weeks, the situation began to improve, and the mortality rate declined. As more survivors regained their health, glimmers of normal life began to emerge. Inmates obtained musical instruments and held concerts and dances. One Red Cross relief worker wrote home saying that\\\\\"Belsen is very gay, parties and internee concerts every night.\\\\\" One of the most remarkable and bizarre episodes occurred when a large shipment of lipstick mysteriously arrived at the camp. The overworked doctors were initially annoyed because they were expecting desperately needed medical supplies. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2008}, {\"paperId\": \"0fb569f6d94b3d74a8d0b73e6b68a4a6e212a60a\", \"title\": \"How to teach the Holocaust\", \"abstract\": \"Anxious Histories is a micro-historical analysis of the ways in which teachers in Jewish day schools in two major urban centres in the western world approach the subject of the Holocaust history in their curricula. Focussing on five schools in Melbourne, Australia, and seven schools in New York City, Jordana Silverstein analyses how teachers pass the \\\\u2018knowledge\\\\u2019 of the history of the Holocaust on the children and young students. As the author explains, this is not \\\\u2018a longitudinal study of Holocaust education: this is more a snapshot, or a glimpse at an archive captured at one year [2006] in time\\\\u2019 (p. 5). Anchored in comprehensive theoretical discussions and evaluations of up-to-date Holocaust historiography, the analysis offers a close reading of supplied curricula (from seven schools) and interviews with teachers, conducted by the author. In the main argument, Silverstein posits that the development of the teaching approaches is shaped and reshaped by the Jews\\\\u2019 anxieties about their current position in non-Jewish societies worldwide, but also by their relations with Zionism, which is often understood in very broad and unclear terms, such as support for the State of Israel (101). Silverstein covers a whole range of topics throughout the book, including but not limited to the structure of the individual curricula, the use of survivors\\\\u2019 testimonies and survivors\\\\u2019 visits in the classroom, the question of memory and \\\\u2018deep memory\\\\u2019 in the curriculum and Holocaust historiography at large, the settler-colonial (US and Australia) and Zionist influences on the teaching, and the question of gender and the representation of women. As she consistently argues, the particular modes in which the teachers narrate these topics are all shaped by the underlining efforts to manage their own anxieties about the Jews\\\\u2019 position in the society and \\\\u2018to determine identity formations in a situation which requires the negotiation of feeling of displacement and the accompanying anxieties\\\\u2019 (87). The teachers desperately want to be part of the cultures and nations they live in (and they wish the same for their students), but in their classes dealing with violence and the Jewish genocide, they are continuously reminded about the uncertain position of the Jews in the world and thus \\\\u2013 perhaps unconsciously as Silverstein posits \\\\u2013 vent their anxieties in the ways in which they construct the courses on Holocaust histories (208).

Although many Jews prospered economically on the island, they always remained outsiders, denied access to political influence and to high society. Unlike Jewish communities elsewhere, Jews in Cuba played virtually no cultural or intellectual role. Ironically, those who emigrated to the United States as politically (and economically) desirable refugees after the 1959 revolution were the same Jews, or the children of the same Jews, who had been deemed undesirable and denied U.S. entry in the 1920s. Robert Levine interviewed nearly a hundred Cuban-Jewish immigrants in the course of writing this book, and his use of their words lends the work an especially engaging, lively quality and makes it a vivid reflection of how the immigrants thought and felt and lived. The pages contain more than seventy-five rare photographs of the island and of the Jewish community from its origins to its near-moribund state today. Levine also compares the experience of Cuba\\'s Jews with that of other immigrant groups, as well as that of Holocaust survivors in other Caribbean and Central American countries. The book\\'s broad scope thus gives it appeal not only for students of Latin American Jewish issues but for all those interested in the relationship between majority and minoritysocieties in the Americas.\", \"year\": 1993}, {\"paperId\": \"104794dedc0048cad4a0e5ff3360580b5add7cb8\", \"title\": \"Art History\", \"abstract\": \"The study of art history encompasses the visual art, architecture, and material culture of a wide range of regions and historical periods.

Majors and minors are strongly encouraged to take at least one 10000-level course to meet their general education requirements. To meet their art history degree requirements, majors and minors can count an additional two 10000-level courses.

He describes a lively debate that began after the group watched the taped testimony of a woman who was an eyewitness to the Auschwitz uprising in which prisoners set fire to the camp. The woman reported four chimneys going up in flames and exploding, but historians insisted that since there was only one chimney blown up, her testimony was incorrect and should be discredited in its entirety because she proved herself an unreliable witness. One historian suggested that her testimony should be discounted because she \\\\\"ascribes importance to an attempt that, historically, made no difference\\\\\" (Felman 1992, 61 ). The psychoanalysts responded that the woman was not testifying to the number of chimneys blown up but to something more \\\\\"radical\\\\\" and more \\\\\"crucial,\\\\\" namely, the seemingly unimaginable occurrence of Jewish resistance at Auschwitz, that is to say, the historical truth of Jewish resistance at Auschwitz. Laub concludes that what the historians could not hear, listening for empirical facts, was the \\\\\"very secret of survival and of resistance to extermination\\\\\" (Felman 1992, 62). While the historians were listening to hear confirmation of what they already knew, the psychoanalysts where listening to hear something new, something beyond comprehension. While the historians were trying to recognize empirical facts in the survivors\\' testimonies, the psychoanalysts were trying to acknowledge that the import of these testimonies was unrecognizable. Although undeniably powerful in their impact, the empirical facts of the Holocaust are dead to that which cannot be reported by the eye-witness, the unseen in vision and the unspoken in speech, that which is beyond recognition in history, the process of witnessing itself. In this essay, I want to elaborate a notion of witnessing as an alternative to recognition as a basis for subjectivity. Witnessing is defined as the action of bearing witness or giving testimony, the fact of being present and observing something, from witness which is defined as to bear witness, to testify, to give evidence, to be a spectator or auditor of something, to be present as an observer, to see with one\\'s own eyes (OED, 3904). It is important to note that witnessing has both the juridical connotations of seeing with one\\'s own eyes and the religious connotations of testifying to that which cannot be seen, or bearing witness. It is this double meaning that makes witnessing such a powerful alternative to recognition in formulating identity and ethical relations. Contemporary theory is still dominated by conceptions of identity or subjectivity that inherit a Hegelian notion of recognition. In various ways, these theories describe how we recognize ourselves in our likeness as the same or in opposition to what is (or those who are) different from ourselves. Relations with others are described as struggles for recognition. But, if we start from the assumption that relations are essentially antagonistic struggles for recognition, then it is no wonder that contemporary theorists spend so much energy trying to imagine how these struggles can lead to compassionate personal relations, ethical social relations, or democratic political relations. From the presumption that human relations are essentially warlike, how can we imagine them as peaceful? In this essay, on the one hand, I challenge the Hegelian notion that subjectivity is the result of hostile conflict-Axel Honneth\\'s struggle for recognition or Judith Butler\\'s subordination that makes the subject\\'s turn inward possible. On the other hand, I challenge notions of subjectivity based on a logic of exclusion-Butler\\'s foreclosed object of desire or Julia Kristeva\\'s abject. I am concerned with the question what of the subject position of the othered? \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2000}, {\"paperId\": \"10b706f898bcda0bf9511f6ace336f1c40c112cb\", \"title\": \"Acknowledgments\", \"abstract\": \"The article explores the situation, post-Holocaust Viennese society and rising anti-Semitism in Waldheim-Austria, and the background against which Schwaiger, an established mainstream Austrian author, writes the life history of Deutsch, a Holocaust survivor from Silesia whose native language is Yiddish.

Survivors\\\\u2019 preoccupation with this issue could be understood as a response to the context in which they find themselves, in which a particular social discourse about survivors has developed. This discourse arguably engendered particular responses from survivors: it is a question that survivors expect to be asked, and it is seen as part of their prescribed role.

Troubled Memory (Powell, 2000) traces the odyssey of Anne Skorecki Levy, a child survivor of the Lodz and Warsaw ghettos who immigrated with her family to New Orleans in 1949. Though the story line begins and ends in Louisiana, a place whose history I know well by virtue of teaching it, the book cuts a wide swath through prewar and wartime Poland and postwar Germany. There\\'s no question of my qualifications to research and write about the U.S. Civil War and Reconstruction-and southern history, generally. But modern European history? My training in that field is scant, my prior knowledge of the Holocaust rudimentary at best. So how is it that I wandered so far afield? The only answer I can offer is that Troubled Memory is not the book I set out to write. An unexpected encounter with survivor testimony pulled me off course. It began on a Sunday afternoon when a big-time literary agent telephoned me at home from California, saying I should write a book about the stop-Duke movement. The call came shortly after our rapscallion ex-Governor, Edwin Edwards, had defeated ex-Klansman David Duke in the high-turnout 1991 gubernatorial runoff election. Famously known as \\\\\"the race from hell,\\\\\" the campaign had attracted media attention from around the world. Because of my leadership in a political-action committee dedicated to exposing Duke\\'s neo-Nazi sympathies, reporters from print and broadcast media often sought me out for quotes and insights. The book agent thought that this national exposure would make it possible for me to write a successful book about how ordinary people had come together across racial and religious lines to defeat the threat Duke had posed to democratic decency and civility. She said big bucks were a distinct possibility; big prizes, too. I gave the suggestion hard thought for about thirty seconds before accepting. The subject certainly seemed important. Louisiana in the late 1980s and early \\'90s was facing a political threat unlike any other I had personally witnessed. Posing as a born-again Republican conservative, and exploiting the economic and moral anxieties arising simultaneously from the oil patch depression and New Orleans\\'s crack cocaine epidemic, David Duke had managed to garner between 600,000 and 700,000 white voters in two statewide elections, one for the U.S. Senate, the other for the governorship-an astonishing 55 percent to 60 percent of the white vote. Not only this, but he also caught the national conservative movement totally by surprise, hijacking Republican issues and raiding their funding base. Guilt-by-association fears that Duke might pull a hood over the head of every Republican in the country is probably why the first President Bush signed the 1991 Civil Rights bill. Bush pere badly needed to distance his party from the nouvelle Nazi who had crashed the party. My intention when I began the project was to capture the individual stones of how ordinary people had worked against type to bear witness against Duke and ultimately swamp him with a massive turnout. I knew the conventional wisdom was wrong: that economic self-preservation alone had caused the tidal wave, that voters were lashed by fears a Duke victory would ruin tourism and cause redlining of Louisiana\\'s businesses. I knew such explanations were half-truths. The election had unleashed a huge surge of ethical energy. It was evident in the way staid businessmen reached into their pockets to buy personal television testimonials, or National Guard commanders spoke out on camera in medal-laden uniforms. Even the author of our most famous bumper sticker- \\\\\"Vote for the Crook. It\\'s Important\\\\\" -conceded he was moved by profound moral concerns. Anne Levy was similarly stirred, and I planned on opening the book with an account of her well-publicized confrontation with recently elected State Representative David Duke in the rotunda of Huey Long\\'s skyscraper state capital. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2003}, {\"paperId\": \"119b212980a199fa96b85deff8238cef5d0879f2\", \"title\": \"Biographical research methods\", \"abstract\": \"VOLUME ONE: TIME AND BIOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH PART ONE: \\'THE PLACE OF HISTORY\\' Uses of History -

Although Holocaust survivors described the lived experience of using community aged care services in terms of universal themes similar to those identified with other groups of care recipients, the data revealed that this experience is intertwined with individual earlier-life traumatic experiences.

However, going through the war with family did not guarantee the narration of emotional memories; close to half of these victims could not recall/narrate such memories. In general, when the survivor recalled relative emotional security, she or he felt safe, even when physical danger was imminent. However, this feeling did not always continue when the physical situation worsened or when the survivor was separated from loved ones.

Despite the passing of many decades the impact of Holocaust related trauma exposure was evident in the narratives of child survivors both in the form of traumatic stress symptoms and features of traumatic bereavement.

Ten 2GH and 3GH participants opted to complete the additional qualitative interview in which they were asked questions about their experiences as a descendant of a Holocaust survivor. Results showed that third-generation survivors endorsed more symptomatology than the matched comparison group; however, second generation survivors did not endorse more symptomatology than second generation match comparisons. Additionally, when descendants reported less adaptive family communication, affect responsiveness, and family cohesion, they reported higher levels of symptomatology. Lastly, we found that descendants who reported turning toward religion during times of stress (positive religious coping) endorsed higher levels of obsessive-compulsive and anxiety symptoms and those who endorsed turning away from religion in times of stress (negative religious coping) reported more depressive symptoms.

Long before the Yale Fortunoff Archive and the Spielberg Foundation began to videotape survivor testimony, Boder grasped the importance of getting fi rst-hand interviews from survivors. In a little over two months in Europe\\\\u2014from July 29 until October 4\\\\u2014Boder carried out 130 interviews in nine languages. As Alan Rosen points out in this magnifi cent account of a neglected pioneer of the study of testimony and trauma, Boder conducted some of the earliest, if not the earliest, audio interviews of Holocaust survivors. In addition to interviews, Boder also collected songs, and he used his wire recorder to good effect. Many survivors who were initially reluctant to speak to Boder were won over when they heard their songs played back. \\\\u201cThe wonder of their voices\\\\u201d broke down some barriers and facilitated a critical meeting between a resourceful Jewish psychologist and survivors who had just emerged from the war and had not yet begun the struggle to rebuild their lives. Boder reached them at a critical time, when memories were still fresh. Boder began the project for many reasons. As a psychologist he grasped how important it was to trace the impact of the disaster on the human personality. As a Jew he instinctively understood that his ancestral home was irretrievably destroyed, and he wanted to reach out to survivors. As an American, he wanted his fellow citizens to see Displaced Persons as individuals, not as an anonymous and threatening mass. Perhaps his work, he hoped, might help break down prejudices against opening America\\\\u2019s doors. Unlike many Jews in the Displaced Persons camps, Boder was decidedly a universalist, not a Zionist. His own background uniquely equipped him for his pioneering mission. He was a Latvian Jew who spanned the traditional culture of East European Jewry and the world of European and American social science.

One way to respond to the questions that arise when the images and associations of the Holocaust come to be disseminated throughout the culture at large\\\\u2014and particularly in popular culture\\\\u2014is to try to restore to Holocaust experience a special status. How the experience is special, and to whom it especially belongs, are questions that contributors explore.

To date, no randomized controlled study has been carried out to examine the effectiveness of psychotherapy in HS. The present case studies report the implementation of life review therapy (LRT-HS) undertaken with two female HS with symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The mixed-methods approach sheds light to their individual therapy courses and potential mechanisms of change. Both therapies took place in the context of a randomized controlled study evaluating the efficacy of LRT-HS.

Patients received about 20 sessions of LRT-HS, including a structured life review, narrative exposure, as well as cognitive and behavioral elements.

Yet the tragedy of the violent events of 1947, which saw mass displacement, death, abduction, and rape, is punctuated by silence. Such silence is comparable to that surrounding the Holocaust, which is the focus of Shoshana Felman and Dori Laub\\'s invaluable work, Testimony: Crises of Witnessing in Literature, Psychoanalysis, and History. This book presents silence as the \\'fated exile\\' of many victims or survivors of trauma and suggests that, though it can be regarded as a place of defeat, silence is also a sanctuary where certain words do not have to be spoken (Felman and Laub 58). In this way, silence is portrayed as a black hole, echoing the black hole of genocide. However, Laub, as a psychoanalyst, works with those survivors who attempt to learn how to tell the story of their trauma, for he states trauma is \\\\\"an event that has no beginning, no ending, no before, no during and no after and is therefore \\'outside the range of comprehension\\'\\\\\" (ibid 69).

We addressed the research question: What can adolescents who are using their bodies to gain empathy with Anne Frank teach us about embodied literacies? Digital images and video were used to generate a multimodal analytic method that combined focus group interviewing with the Semiotic Photo Response Protocol and Visual Discourse Analysis. Analyses of performance and visual arts texts illustrated how students layered their understandings as they recast meanings across sign systems. As students engaged their bodies in space, in motion, and in character, they learned about the socio-historical and emotional contexts in which Anne lived. These IJEA Vol. 17 No. 5 http://www.ijea.org/v17n5/ 2 findings suggest that arts-integrated and embodied learning opportunities may support students\\\\u2019 sensemaking about complex narratives. The Anne Frank narrative has long occupied a prominent place in English language arts (ELA) and social studies curriculums in the United States. Anne\\\\u2019s life and writing deserve even greater attention today as the number of living Holocaust survivors dwindles and the last living testimonies cease to exist. Although a number of meaningful projects have sought to ensure that the voices of Holocaust survivors live on in perpetuity, the Anne Frank narrative is for many middle grades students the first and only exposure they have to the Holocaust (Magilow & Silverman, 2015). It is likely also the only personal Jewish narrative they encounter officially in the ELA curriculum. Therefore, the ways in which classroom instruction frames this powerful topic shapes how students connect personally with Anne\\\\u2019s narrative and the questions and meanings they construct about the Holocaust. We examined the use of an arts-based instructional framework to engage middle school learners in developing empathetic perspectives on the Anne Frank narrative. Taking on another\\\\u2019s perspective to empathize is a 21st-century skill that can develop through relational literacy practices (Chisholm & Keller, 2014). Middle school students today encounter the harsh realities of life in their local and global communities. For example, students in this project used the arts to grapple with socio-political issues like rape culture, body image, and domestic violence. Students raised critical questions about the nature of such ethically and emotionally difficult topics in affective and cognitive ways. We conceptualized empathy as a relational literacy practice that places one\\\\u2019s body and mind in the context of another, thereby affording the learner multiple perspectives on texts and the capacity to draw on those perspectives to act in the world. We asked the research question: What can adolescents who are using their bodies to gain empathy with Anne Frank teach us about embodied literacies? In this article, we examine two examples of multimodal literacy learning that were part of an embodied approach to ELA and social studies instruction. Our parallel multimodal analysis made visible the ways in which students used their bodies in space, in motion, and in character to learn about Anne Frank. This work contributes to the pedagogical and methodological literature about arts-based literacy instruction by examining the multimodal processes and texts students used and constructed as part of learning about the Holocaust. 1 For example, the University of Southern California Shoah Foundation\\\\u2019s Institute for Visual History and Education, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\\\\u2019s First Person podcast series and Echoes of Memory writing workshops for survivors of the Holocaust. Chisholm & Whitmore: Bodies in Space/Bodies in Motion/Bodies in Character 3 Sociocultural and Multimodal Perspectives on Literacy and Learning This study is grounded in the sociocultural notion that all learning is mediated, or brought about through cultural tools of various sorts (Kozulin, 2003; Wertsch, 2007) and that issues of identity, agency, and power shape in consequential ways how and to what ends learners engage in literacy tasks (Lewis, Enciso, & Moje, 2007). Vygotsky (1982) identifies the concept of mediation as \\\\u201cthe central fact about our psychology\\\\u201d (p. 166). From a sociocultural perspective, mediation\\\\u2014the process by which meaning is realized primarily although not exclusively through language\\\\u2014is consequential to learning (Kozulin, 1998). In other words, signs mediate thinking \\\\u201cexternally\\\\u201d and meanings mediate thinking \\\\u201cinternally\\\\u201d (Moll, 2014, p. 34). Mediational means in instructional settings include not only tangible human and symbolic tools such as teachers, students, and texts, but also less obvious, and often overlooked tools such as images, bodies, and spatial relationships. In fact, Moll (2014) synthesizes Vygotskian theorists\\\\u2019 work on mediation to categorize the concept according to five classes of mediators, two of which we pay particular attention to in this study: \\\\u201c[s]emiotic mediation: the use of symbol systems, such as language, writing, art, and mathematics [and] [a]natomical mediation: the use of the body, such as the hands and arms, which permit manipulation of the environment and representation of self in social life\\\\u201d (p. 31). We recognize the power of mediation for making distant historical, literary, and cultural content more concrete for youth. We consider the ways in which learners use art and language (semiotic mediation) and their bodies in space, in motion, and in character (anatomical mediation) to learn about Anne Frank. For this study, we foreground the mediating affordances of diverse sign systems. Gestural, musical, sculptural, visual, and other modes are ways students make and transform meaning with others in addition to verbal communication. Multimodality, which is the combination of different modes, increases learners\\\\u2019 access points to the curriculum (Albers, 2006), generates insights into texts and students\\\\u2019 own lives (Berghoff, Egawa, Harste, & Hoonan, 2000; Pahl & Rowsell, 2005) and offers additional means for students to demonstrate understanding. In particular, we leverage for analytical purposes the semiotic concept of transmediation (Siegel, 1995; Suhor, 1984). Transmediation occurs when students interpret texts that originate in one sign system and recast that meaning into another sign system. In our study transmediation refers to variations on \\\\u201cthe process of taking what one knows in language and representing it in art\\\\u201d (Harste, 2014, p. 88), and, vice versa, by putting words and verbal expression to visual images. As Albers (2006) argues, \\\\u201cmeaning is not located within any one mode, but in how the modes are interpreted in relation to each other\\\\u201d (p. 77). Transmediating understandings across IJEA Vol. 17 No. 5 http://www.ijea.org/v17n5/ 4 semiotic systems is shown to expand students\\\\u2019 perspectives (Cowan & Albers, 2006) and extend the interpretive potential of texts (Zoss, 2009). \\\\u201cSimultaneously tapping the nonredundant potentials of talk and visual representation extends the generative and reflective power of transmediation\\\\u201d (Whitin, 2005, p. 392). The importance of this concept cannot be underestimated. In fact, literacy, according to some scholars, is reflected in a learner\\\\u2019s ease with which he or she can transmediate (Cowan & Albers, 2006; Harste, 2000). The ability to mediate the actual world and the perceived world through multiple sign systems promotes the power of students\\\\u2019 voices, and quite possibly the critical consciousness of our society, resulting in potentially more democratic interactions within and among cultures (Harste, 2000, 2014). Review of Literature We situate this study in two areas of the research literature\\\\u2014research on teaching and learning literature about the Holocaust and research on embodied literacies. Our study fits in the intersection of these areas to particularly attend to what students taught us about embodied literacies as they drew empathetic connections between their contemporary lives and the life of Anne Frank and grappled with incomprehensible content that can only be \\\\u201cworked through\\\\u201d and never \\\\u201ccomprehended\\\\u201d (LaCapra, 1996; Simon et al., 2014). Research on Teaching and Learning Literature about the Holocaust Research on Holocaust education in K-12 ELA and social studies classrooms continues to emphasize the complexities and controversies surrounding the design, implementation, and evaluation\\\\u2014indeed the larger purpose\\\\u2014of instruction about this topic. Among the complexities and controversies that have arisen within educational studies of the Holocaust, scholars consider the unintended consequences of teachers\\\\u2019 unexamined assumptions about the moralistic, didactic, and authoritative messages embedded in the study of texts with \\\\u201cdisturbing pasts\\\\u201d (Juzwik, 2013; Schweber, 2004). Text selections that sensationalize and trivialize individuals\\\\u2019 experiences during the Holocaust (Spector & Jones, 2007) and problematic ways of framing the historical facts of the Holocaust have led to student misconceptions and a tendency to produce gross generalizations that distance the persons and events of the Holocaust from contemporary life (Gray, 2010; Schmidt, 2009). In reflecting on her experiences teaching a unit on Anne Frank as an early career English teacher, Juzwik (2013) identifies the tension that emerged as she sought to maintain her transactional literacy goals for her students while also attempting to \\\\u201cengage the detailed particularity of the Holocaust\\\\u201d (p. 291). Anne Frank\\\\u2019s writing connects with many readers and such connections are often held up as \\\\u201cbest practice\\\\u201d in ELA classrooms.

While most readers may already have some knowledge about the role of gender in the Holocaust (e.g., the oft-depicted separation of men from women during selections in the concentration camps), this book tells us much more. Tec uses a wide array of data (including individual testimonies and memoirs as well as her own interviews with survivors) to assess the differences in men\\\\u2019s and women\\\\u2019s experiences in a variety of settings, including concentration camps as well as ghettos and resistance organizations. The stories and quotes she presents are painful to read, but they are also quite rich and clearly illustrative of gender differences. For instance, because European Jewish men and women occupied different positions in prewar society (with men acting as economic providers and women assuming responsibility for the care of the family and home), they brought different sets of resources with them to each situation (e.g., ghetto or camp). In the ghettos, where many men were precluded from working in their pre-war occupations, their inability to provide for their families often caused depression; many respondents recalled their fathers and other adult males withdrawing and \\\\u201cgiving up.\\\\u201d In contrast, women\\\\u2019s traditional work of feeding the family was especially valued in the ghettos, where food and water shortages put women\\\\u2019s domestic skills to the test. Tec therefore suggests that women experienced less of a disjuncture between their pre-war and wartime roles than men did. In one particularly sad set of quotes, some respondents admitted that they did not remember ever having seen their mothers eat while in the ghetto. These examples suggest that even under the dire circumstances of the ghettos, women were better able to live up to their expected roles, whereas men had more difficulties doing so. By choosing the subtitle \\\\u201cWomen, Men, and the Holocaust,\\\\u201d however, the author might be a little too humble in her own summary of her findings. That is, this book is not just about gender differences in the Holocaust experience. Instead, it is an \\\\u201cintersectional\\\\u201d analysis that takes seriously the interactions between gender and a number of other statuses such as class, age, parental status, religiosity, nationality, and culture. For example, while women in general seemed to fare better than men in the camps, it was childless women who were better able to survive, as women who arrived in camps with their children were killed immediately. Class also intersected with gender in interesting ways. Upper class Jewish men had more difficulties adapting to life in the ghettos and camps than did working class Jewish men; upper class men were less likely to have the job skills (e.g., the ability to operate factory machinery) that led to survival, and were more susceptible to the depression and anguish that went along with the loss of ability to provide for the family. For women, however, class distinctions were less meaningful: Tec argues that women\\\\u2019s pre-war class standing reflected their husbands\\\\u2019 position more than their own, which meant that class was less relevant to self-esteem and emotional health. As a woman and a Holocaust survivor herself, it is somewhat surprising that the author has waited until her fifth published book on the Holocaust to pursue an explicitly gendered analysis. As she notes in the book\\\\u2019s Introduction, however, some of her respondents were hesitant to focus on gender differences for fear that doing so would diminish the role of Jewishness in the Holocaust. While respectful of this view, Tec gently pushed her respondents to consider gender as a useful analytic category by presenting other data to them that illustrated gender differences. In my opinion, this is no small point. These respondents\\\\u2019 reluctance to discuss gender, even with a fellow survivor, may well be the reason why we have seen few analyses like this one, and it makes this book all the more important.

French with English subtitles. Nanjing: Memory and Oblivion As its title suggests, this film is less about the Japanese massacre of civilians in Nanking (aka Nanjing) in 1937 than about the struggle between those who insist it be remembered and those who want it erased from history. Unsurprisingly, though, the film spends a significant amount of its running time presenting the facts under dispute. Otherwise, how would we know what the fuss is all about? Thus the film, as in almost any conceivable film of this sort, takes the side of those who wish the massacre to be remembered. (One wonders how a denialist would make a documentary in support of his position. How could he show what is under dispute except by showing it, and thus establishing it? Documentaries are suitable for evidencing a positive, not a negative.) The film presents the widely accepted version of what happened: in 1937, the Japanese army marched into Nanking and, over a period of weeks, slaughtered somewhere between two hundred thousand and three hundred thousand men, women, and children not just indiscriminately but sadistically. Director Prazan assembles his account of the atrocities through interviews with survivors and Japanese veterans, photographs and amateur film footage, newsreel footage, and contemporary newspaper accounts. In the midst of the savagery recounted in this part of the film, two particularly unsettling stories emerge. One of them, sadly ironic, is about one John Rabe, a member of the Nazi Party and head of Siemens\\' Nanking branch. He volunteered to head a \\\\\"safety zone\\\\\" which, although frequently violated, harbored thousands of defenseless Chinese. He alerted Berlin to what was happening, but according to the film\\'s narrator, Hitler was indifferent to the fate of the Nanking Chinese. After the war, in Germany, Rabe was prosecuted for having been a member of the Nazi Party. The other story is that of two Japanese commanding officers who made what they considered an amusing, gentlemanly bet about which of them would be the first personally to kill a hundred Chinese. When one of the officers clocked in with a hundred and six victims and the other just one less, their competition was deemed to close to call, and so the goal was raised to a hundred and fifty. That this gruesome contest was reported on with enthusiasm in Japanese newspapers serves as evidence that it most probably happened. But the broader battle over the extent or even the reality of the Nanking massacre strikingly resembles, in structure, the battle over the historical truth of the Holocaust, and is at some points tied to it. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2009}, {\"paperId\": \"20b0f9089f7356bade5797edc830f52f0a00cfc0\", \"title\": \"The Graphic Memoir: Art Spiegelman\\\\u2019s Maus: A Survivor\\\\u2019s Tale\", \"abstract\": null, \"year\": 2007}, {\"paperId\": \"20ce087d97762ad6d26ed5371eb838c863f05f4f\", \"title\": \"Trauma and Forgiveness: Is the Holocaust traumatic?\", \"abstract\": \"One of the most influential contemporary accounts of psychological trauma, that of Cathy Caruth, does not fit some of the most traumatized men and women of the twentieth century: survivors of the Holocaust.

Forms of testimony include structured and unstructured interviews; audio, video, and written narratives; individual and group formats; and recollections of survivors young and old\\\\u2014from those who testified just after the war to those who only came forth decades later. Different combinations of these distinct forms of testimony contribute to their variety. Most of the time such testimony has aimed to fill out the historical record or deepen moral reflection. Early on, they offered insight into what occurred during the Holocaust, sometimes providing vivid details that revealed the horrific experiences the survivors had endured. This early approach gave those who had not been on the scene an inside look into what actually happened during the Holocaust. Much of the testimony was by those who had experienced the Holocaust themselves. Later, the focus turned to residual trauma and how it manifested itself in the daily life of survivors. Others viewed testimony as potentially therapeutic and elicited it through engaging with survivors in sustained conversations or by encouraging them to give voice to wartime childhood memories. Ultimately, as a more positive and intergenerational perspective began to take hold in the field of psychology, trauma has been seen as something that can be transcended. Hence, some scholars have highlighted the psychological insight to be found within oral and written testimony. Important to note in this context is that a number of Holocaust survivor interview projects have been spearheaded by psychologists.

For many older survivors of historical traumas such as the Holocaust, natural disasters, and childhood abuses, to name but a few, this will come as no surprise as they deal with chronic symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, and/or suicidal ideation. In addition, there are also impacts on physical and cognitive health, but these will not be considered here. Psychological outcomes are quite varied. Over the past decade, there has been research exploring moderating and mediating factors of late-life mental health outcomes of trauma, for example, the impact of the timing of the trauma in the life course (Ogle et al., 2013), the type of trauma (Beristianos et al., 2016), and the interaction of sex differences and types of trauma experiences from wartime (Korinek et al., 2017). There is also a body of work that has explored post-traumatic growth (e.g. Forstmeier et al., 2009; Holtge et al., 2018). The study by Vasiliadis et al. (2019) in this issue of International Psychogeriatrics adds to the field by exploring sex differences, the types of lifetime trauma, and the pathways from trauma to mental health outcomes in late life. Its strengths and weaknesses illustrate some of the challenges that researchers encounter in this field along with some ways to mitigate them.

It has a large sample size of 1811 participants aged over 64 years who were screened for cognitive functioning with the MiniMental State Examination, and only those scoring over 21 continued the interviews. Self-report data on lifetime traumatic life events, suicidal ideation, daily hassles, health concerns, symptoms of post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression, social support, pain, and demographic data were linked with Quebec\\\\u2019s administrative data on health care, medications, and physician diagnoses which were used for anxiodepressive disorders. Using path analysis, in which the relationships between variables are assumed to be linear and additive (whichmight not necessarily be the case), Vasiliadis et al. examined the relationships between lifetime traumas, post-traumatic stress and anxio-depressive disorders, and suicidal ideation in the previous 6months for males and females separately. They found that the effects of lifetime trauma persist into old age and that the association between different traumas and suicidal ideation is partially mediated by post-traumatic stress syndrome and/or anxiodepressive disorder with sex-specific pathways. In males, traumas of sexual assault, violence/stalked, war/combat/imprisonment, and daily hassles were directly associated with suicidal ideation, while in females, only daily hassles were directly associated with suicidal ideation. For females, post-traumatic stressmediated the relationship between some lifetime traumas and suicidal ideation, while in males, a number of traumas were associated with suicidal ideation through the mediating effect of post-traumatic stress and anxio-depressive disorder. While these findings need to be replicated, the findings of different sex-specific pathways linking trauma with suicidal ideation are important as it is suggestive that different approaches might be needed for males and females in suicide prevention, an observation that is consistent with sex differences found in the outcomes of late-life suicide prevention programs (Lapierre et al., 2011). Sex differences have also been reported in the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions where women as compared to men were more likely to report moderate or high occurrence stressful life events and that the associations between stressful life events and multiple psychiatric disorders were stronger in women compared to men (Armstrong et al., 2018).

The interview was conscience sensitive in nature and the professional, invited to help course participants understand how personal conscience figured in professionalism and ethics was, accordingly, known as \\'the professional of conscience\\'. Among those who agreed to be interviewed were social workers, psychiatric and other physicians, a businessman who was a survivor of the Holocaust, and a minister who had become an activist on behalf of gay rights and persons living with HIV.

Room was needed for other courses in an expanding curriculum and, when the time allotted CCPE was reduced, the interview of \\'a professional of conscience\\' was one of the features lost. However, balancing this loss of role modeling, a more interactive group experience was gained in which participants became engaged in responding to inquiries about themselves undergoing their own transformation as persons to professionals of conscience. Nonetheless, the preceptors of the course, now among the editorial staff of Conscience Works) remember how richly rewarding it was to have seasoned professionals in conversation about conscience.

In the past, companies had to create and manually analyze written transcripts of audio content because using computers to recognize, interpret, and analyze digitized speech was difficult. However, the development of faster microprocessors, larger storage capacities, and better speech-recognition algorithms has made audio mining easier. Now, the technology is on the verge of becoming a powerful tool that could help many organizations. For example, companies could use audio mining to analyze customer-service and helpdesk conversations or even voice mail. Law enforcement and intelligence organizations could use the technology to analyze intercepted phone conversations. Public relations firms could use it to analyze news broadcasts to find coverage of clients.\", \"year\": 2002}, {\"paperId\": \"24b8cc8b415708c5ebf8c6980bf3fca8bfc244ca\", \"title\": \"Hitlers Menschenh\\\\u00e4ndler. das Schicksal der \\\\u00abAustauschjuden\\\\u00bb\", \"abstract\": \"German Studies across the DisciplinesAmmann, Thomas, and Stefan Aust. Hitlers Menschenhandler. Das Schicksal der Mustauschjuden\\\\u00bb. Berlin: Rotbuch Verlag, 2013. 334 pp. euro24.99 (hardcover).It does not happen every day that a reviewer turns out to be one of the main actors of the book he has been asked to review. This is one of those rare cases. In Hitlers Menschenhandler, I appear frequently as a Holocaust survivor who was rescued from the concentration camp of Bergen-Belsen after spending five months there at the age of eleven.Let me start with a small correction and a criticism. The correction: I am not, as the authors claim, from Slovakia, but from Cluj in Transylvania, which belonged to Romania when I was born, was handed to Hungary for services rendered by Hitler in 1940, and returned to Romania, for the same reason, by Stalin in 1945.The criticism: the authors thank the protagonists of the book, a number of Holocaust survivors, for allowing themselves to be interviewed, but they do not mention that these interviews first entered the public domain in a documentary shown on German television. The documentary acknowledged three creators: Ammann, Aust, and Caroline Schmidt, who was responsible for recording the interview with me. In the book, Ammann and Aust rely mainly on the German version ofmy book, Dealingwith Satan. RezsBKasztnersDaringRescue Mission (London: Jonathan Cape 2008): Geschafte mit dem Teufel. Die Tragodie des Judenretters Rezso Kasztner (Cologne: Bohlau Verlag, 2010). But despite to some extent also quoting me from Caroline Schmidt\\'s interview for the original documentary, they mention neither that interview nor Caroline Schmidt.It is not widely known that during World War II some Jews were spared the \\\\\"Final Solution\\\\\" in order to be exchanged for German nationals held in enemy countries. With that aim, they were kept alive in Bergen-Belsen, which was not an extermination camp but which became notorious for the lethal consequences of overcrowding and callous neglect. When \\\\\"Belsen\\\\\" in the last months of the war became a hell in which thousands died of starvation and typhus, most of the \\\\\"exchange Jews\\\\\" were still waiting to be exchanged.Basically, the book breaks down into two parts. The first deals with Jews from the Netherlands, including refugees from Germany. The second, somewhat longer and more dramatic, deals with Jews from Hungary, including refugees from East European countries. The obvious link between the two discrete parts is the location Bergen-Belsen and the theme of attempted rescue.Hitler\\'s army invaded the Netherlands on 10 May 1940. Anti-Jewish measures began immediately. The Jews were gradually deprived of all their rights and possessions and confined in holding camps before being shipped off to the death camps. The most notorious was Westerbork. From here, between 1942 and 1944, some 97,000 Jews were deported to Auschwitz, Sobibor, and Theresienstadt. About 3,700 others were taken to Bergen-Belsen. They were held in the \\\\\"Sternlager,\\\\\" where they had to wear the yellow star, do hard labor, and suffered ill-treatment. Their backgrounds varied, but they had managed to acquire documents -some genuine, some fictitious-that promised to admit them to Allied or neutral countries. However, in the event, very few escaped that way. Many of them died in Bergen-Belsen; others were liberated by Allied troops either from Bergen-Belsen itself or while being transported to other camps. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2014}, {\"paperId\": \"250a56d6f98ceb7c6e8b608b4a3ae308ebf13b52\", \"title\": \"Health Care Provider Considerations in Providing Care to Aging Patients with Early Life Trauma\", \"abstract\": \"Health care providers work with an increasing aging population, one with numerous trauma survivors.

The report used the term cyberscholarship to describe new forms of research that become possible when high-performance computing meets digital libraries. [1] Elsewhere in this issue of the Journal of Electronic Publishing, Ronald Larsen describes the workshop and its conclusions. In this article, William Arms gives a personal view of the motivation behind the workshop and the roles of libraries and publishing in achieving its goals. In a recent seminar, Gregory Crane of Tufts University made the simple but profound statement, \\\\\"When collections get large, only the computer reads every word\\\\\". [2] Thomas Jefferson\\'s library, which formed the nucleus of the Library of Congress, had 6,487 volumes\\\\u2014a large private collection in its day. [3] Edward Gibbon\\'s famous library catalog had 2,675 records (which he wrote on the back of playing cards). [4] Avid readers, like Jefferson and Gibbon, can read and digest thousands of books, but modern research libraries are so large that nobody can read everything in them. The marriage of high-performance computing with digital libraries introduces a completely new notion of scale. High-performance computing can bring together vast quantities of material\\\\u2014datasets, manuscripts, reports, etc.\\\\u2014that might never make their way into a traditional library. A scholar reads only a few hundreds of documents; a supercomputer can analyze millions. Of course, a person has a rich understanding of what is being read while a computer works at a very superficial level, but profound research is possible by simple analysis of huge amounts of information. Computer programs can identify latent patterns of information or relationships that will never be found by human searching and browsing. This new form of research can be called cyberscholarship. Cyberscholarship becomes possible only when there are digital libraries with extensive collections in a broad domain. Such collections are large even by supercomputing standards. For instance, the USC Shoah Foundation\\'s video collection of 52,000 interviews with survivors of genocide, notably the Nazi holocaust, is about 400 terabytes. [5] The Library of Congress\\'s National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program (NDIIPP) supports collaborative projects to preserve digital content. [6] There is no published estimate for the aggregate size of these projects, but a rough estimate is at least one petabyte or 1,000 terabytes. Many research libraries have begun to digitize the books in their collections, working with organizations such as the Open Content Alliance, Google, or Microsoft. These collections are becoming very large. Digitized copies of the eight million books in the Cornell library alone will generate an estimated four petabytes of data. A plausible view of today\\'s developments sees these digital collections as the future of research libraries. Already, many scientists never enter a library building or read the printed copy of a journal. Their reports, working papers, conference proceedings, datasets, images, audio, videos, software, and journal articles are created in digital formats and accessed via networks, and a large proportion of older content has been EPUB\", \"year\": 2008}, {\"paperId\": \"25fcf3ca0da270dc45b8d1c42377ab1b23546570\", \"title\": \"They Called Me Mayer July: Painted Memories of a Jewish Childhood in Poland Before the Holocaust (review)\", \"abstract\": \"Mayer Kirshenblatt and Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, They Called Me Mayer July: Painted Memories of a Jewish Childhood in Poland Before the Holocaust. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007. 411 pp. In the 1930s, Poland was home to the largest Jewish community in Europe, forming 10% of that nation\\'s total population, with an almost 1000-year history reaching back to the beginnings of Poland itself. A substantial number of Jews inhabited bigger urban areas, primarily working in trade, manufacturing, and craft cottage industries. Most, however, resided in smaller towns and villages where over the centuries they created a unique kind of community, the shtetl (Yiddish diminutive for shtot, or town), living alongside the largely Catholic population, many of them peasants. \\\\\"Morally and spiritually, the two societies remained resolutely separate, by choice on both sides. Yet they lived in close physical proximity and...familiarity. In the shtetl, pluralism was experienced not as ideology, but as ordinary life\\\\\" (Hoffman 1997:12). Reading They Called Me Mayer July, one gets a sense of what such a life was like in interwar Poyln, as Poland was known to Yiddish-speaking Jews. Through his recollections and stories, illustrated with over 200 paintings and drawings, full of remarkable details of daily communal life, Mayer Kirshenblatt offers us a unique window onto a world that no longer exists. And it is this latter fact that also makes this book an important contribution to our understanding of the Holocaust and the degree to which it succeeded in erasing a life-way, a culture, a history, a community. At the very start of the book, Kirshenblatt explains how he was drawn to this project, when he taught himself to paint at the age of 73. He would get together \\\\\" in the steam room at the gym or in a corner of the health club\\\\\" with his buddies, most of whom were Holocaust survivors. Within five or ten minutes of any conversation, whether the topic was politics, women, this or that, we would be back in the concentration camps, on the march, in the railroad cars, in the bush with the partisans. It was as if there were no life before the war, so overshadowed had their memories become by the pain they suffered. I lost many members of my family in the Holocaust, but God spared me from living through that horror myself. He also blessed me with a wonderful memory (p. 2). With the help and encouragement of his daughter, Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, anthropologist, folklorist, and co-author of this volume, he set out to recapture that prewar life, creating a visual and textual memoir of his childhood growing up in the rabbinic town of Apt (its Yiddish name, Opatow in Polish), which in 1931 had 5,436 Jews out of a population of 9,512. For many postwar Jews, the shtetl has become the site of Jewish authenticity and a metaphor for loss, according to Eva Hoffman. For some it conjures up \\\\\"poignant, warm images of people in quaint black garb, or Chagall-like crooked streets...For others, it means pogroms and peasant barbarism. Yet while it existed, the shtetl was neither a utopia nor a dystopia, but a coherent, curious, and surprisingly resilient social formation... closely interwoven, reassuringly familiar\\\\\" (Hoffman 1998:11-12). Kirshenblatt manages to capture this latter image without diminishing either the nostalgic or tragic elements the characterized his own life, as well as that of his family and his neighbors. Previous books have documented the diversity and vitality of pre-Holocaust Jewish life in Poland and other East European regions, based on photographs, historical documents, family letters and diaries, and testimonies of those who survived the war (e.g., Eliach 1998, Kacyzne 1999, Vishniac 1983). In fact, one of these, a photographic history titled Image Before My Eyes, is coauthored by Mayer\\'s daughter, Barbara Kirshenblatt- Gimblett with Lucjan Dobroszycki (1977). What makes Kirshenblatt\\'s project unique is the combination of illustration and wide-ranging narrative-created out of forty years of interviews done by the daughter \\\\\" listening with love\\\\\" to the father (p. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2008}, {\"paperId\": \"2653f757d3c39b19eef01a4a3c328398332c7ea3\", \"title\": \"Caring for Life: Nursing During the Holocaust\", \"abstract\": null, \"year\": 2002}, {\"paperId\": \"269b91e2ac68cb5f86ae01a0c3f3c06a2a98b3fe\", \"title\": \"Geographies of the Holocaust: Experiments in GIS, QSR, and Graph Representations\", \"abstract\": \"This article responds to the widespread and oft-noted challenges digital humanists face in working with data that is uncertain and characterised by complex narratives.

Lincoln and London: University of Nebraska Press, 2005. 241 pp. $45.00. Alan Rosen, who has read widely in recent scholarship on the Holocaust, engages the ideas of such thinkers as Dorothy Bilik, Shoshana Felman, Sander Gilman, Alan Mintz, and Hana Wirth-Nesher. Like many of these critics, he approaches the subject of Holocaust history, fiction, and film with an appreciation of spoken and written Polish, Yiddish, Hebrew, and German as well as English languages and traditions. Indeed, what he contributes to our understanding of North American litet ary history in the post-World War II period is a keen awareness of how English itself is challenged and changed, devalued and revalued, marginalized and then oddly centralized by the sounds and senses of idioms more deeply implicated in the everyday disasters that beleaguered European Jewry during the \\\\\"final solution.\\\\\" Because English was not spoken by most petpetrators and victims, North American creators of testimonials and novels, movies and historical investiga- tions often emphasized the problematical language in which they were composing. Foreign accents and words, narratives about lost and found, learned or regained mother and other tongues abound in Rosen\\'s texts, whose audiors for the most part tecognized the marginality and neutrality of English in relation to the Holocaust experience. The chronological and generic range of Rosen\\'s texts is broad: he includes the psychologist David Boder, whose transcribed interviews of displaced persons were printed in English right after the war, John Hersey\\'s novel The Wall (1950), Ruth Chattertons novel Homeward Borne (1950), Philip Roth\\'s short story \\\\\"Eli, The Fanatic\\\\\" (1959), Edward Wallant\\'s novel The Pawnbroker (1961), Hannah Arendts articles on Eichmann in Jerusalem (1963), Sidney Lumet\\'s film adaptation of The Pawnbroker (1965), Cynthia Ozick\\'s two-stoty collection The Shawl (1989), Yaffa Eliach\\'s revision of survivors\\' stories Hasidic Tales of the Holocaust (1988), Art Spiegelman\\'s Maus (1986-91), and Anne Michaels\\'s lyrical novel Fugitive Pieces (1996). Each close reading enables Rosen to elaborate upon the different meanings of the English language\\'s marginality and neutrality in relation to the Shoah. Despite a miserably unreliable Index, teachers will find useful insights into wotks often assigned in Holocaust studies courses. Rosen\\'s discussion of Cynthia Ozick\\'s allusions to Celan and Shakespeare, for instance, enriches understanding of maternal loss in The Shawl. Similarly, Rosen explains how Art Spiegelman\\'s survivor-father gains a measure of control and the means to endure persecution through his acquisition of English and yet how his fractured narrative voice manages \\\\\"to torture English into being a foreign language\\\\\" (p. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2007}, {\"paperId\": \"28955e0f1e33232b1ab82571a7a87395c1369676\", \"title\": \"Interviewing Holocaust survivors: Perceptions on three levels\", \"abstract\": \"For a number of years, I have been researching Jewish immigration to Melbourne from the Polish town of Bia1ystok. Initially my reasons for choosing this city concentrated around my own background, my family having emigrated from Bialystok to Melbourne both before and after World War II. When I commenced this research, I expected - somewhat naively - to work through the traditional stages of immigration history, namely, some description of the respondents I home, their journey to Australia, their reception upon arrival and some of the difficulties encountered in the immigration process. I was unprepared for the layers of experience and psychological interpretations that were, 1n fact, .8 necessary part of interviewing this group of people. What I discovered was that the Holocaust was not simply one set of experiences encountered by my respondents: in fact, it formed an integral and very complicated part of their interpretations of their past, their present and even their attitudes about the future [in the form of second-generation] in many instances. In other words, instead of working through the usual two-phase experience associated with the migration process, there were at least three levels to contend with in the case of Jewish immigrants from Bialystok to Melbourne. These were pre-World War II, the Holocaust, and emigrating to Melbourne after the war. For those respondents who had arrived in Melbourne before the war a parallel although somewhat different structure existed. For although they had not personally experienced the traumas of the Holocaust, most of them had lost their entire families to it and therefore there was a strong residue of emotions, perceptions and experiences which needed to be accounted for, which still formed part of the immigration process. For example, an idealization of the past world of Bialystok, which they had left behind forever when immigrating to Australia, and an almost overwhelming sense of guilt in many cases (that these immigrants had survived the horrors of the Second World War whilst their loved ones had fallen victim to it), were the driving forces leading to the establishment and much of the work of the Bialystok Centre here in Melbourne, an institution which was instrumental in the immigration to Melbourne of hundreds of Bialystok refugees. The involvement of the Australian Jewish Welfare and Relief Society was also linked with the Bialystok Centre and, informally, with Bialystoker, since its president Leo Fink had immigrated to Melbourne from Bialystok shortly before the war.\", \"year\": 1985}, {\"paperId\": \"28bbde482a6f2fc99ec7dc5ead3a7a145c24c270\", \"title\": \"Ruth Beckermann: Documentarian of the Present\", \"abstract\": \"ABSTRACT:Viennese filmmaker Ruth Beckermann is one of Austria\\'s crucial essayists and documentarians.

Shenker\\\\u2019s well-researched monograph is the latest work on a topic that deserves reexamination: the creation and use of Holocaust video testimony in the so-called \\\\u201cera of the witness.\\\\u201d The global effort to film Holocaust testimony that began (roughly) in the late 1970s and peaked in the 1990s constituted a historical event in its own right, as Annette Wieviorka has argued. During this time, scholars such as Geoffrey Hartman, Lawrence Langer, Shoshana Felman, Dori Laub, and Henry Greenspan dedicated substantial books and book chapters to the subject. These witness-critics were oriented toward the present-day, the poetic, and the internal life of the people caught on camera. For various reasons, this psycho-poetic mode of witnesscriticism became much less prominent at the start of the new millenium. Since Christopher Browning published his methodological essay Collected Memories, scholars have tended to draw discrete pieces of empirical information from these testimonies, while leaving aside analytic discussions about the recordings themselves. Strikingly, of late prominent scholars have mentioned these recordings almost dismissively, as foils to other testimony or documentary collections whose value they wish to highlight. In Reframing Holocaust Testimony, Shenker shifts the discussion around video testimony, signaling that scholars have yet to address more dimensions to these memory-making enterprises. Shenker\\\\u2019s most important contributions relate to two new \\\\u201cframes\\\\u201d of analysis: the cinematic decisions involved in creating these sources, what he calls \\\\u201coff-camera dimensions of testimony\\\\u201d; and the differing institutional cultures that produced, then disseminated this video material (pp. 14, 15). The book devotes chapters to three of the leading institutions responsible for recording and archiving tens of thousands of testimonies: the Fortunoff Archive for Holocaust Testimonies at Yale University, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, and the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation. While scholars often encounter rumors and apocrypha about the inner workings of these testimony-recording organizations, Shenker sets the record straight by digging through their internal archives and by interviewing personnel. Shenker was interested in \\\\u201cthe methods interviewers use to engage witnesses in discussions on how [the latter] became aware of events they describe...; the kinds of narrative outlines the archive uses to attempt to structure testimonies, often into coherent, sequential units; and the degree to which subjects are given adequate space in which to assert their own agency in delivering their stories\\\\u201d (p. 13). Shenker is at his best when revealing behind-the-scenes methods of sorting and curating video testimonies, practices viewers and scholars could not otherwise know. We learn, for example, that both the USHMM Oral History Branch and the Shoah Foundation developed internal rating systems for testimonies (pp. 79, 135).

Liberated by the Americans in 1945, Rena made her way to Canada to join her mother, and as of 1994 and the recording of her testimony, she still lived there with her husband and numerous grandchildren. Renas story is one of many in a collection entitled Shards of Memory: Narratives of Holocaust Survival. This volume, edited by Yehudi Lindeman, is part of the Holocaust Video Documentation Archive at McGiIl University known as Living Testimonies. The book offers twenty-five narrative accounts of survivors and one rescuer, all based upon actual video-taped interviews. The book separates the narratives according to the gender of the survivor as well as their particular experience during the Holocaust, whether inside or outside the camps. While these gender differences are not explored specifically in this volume, this has been an area of research and discourse by other Holocaust scholars. In the chapter on women surviving the camps, Rachel G. shares her story of moving from Czechoslovakia to Hungary in 1939, only to find her husband and brother relocated to slave labor camps. Arriving at Auschwitz in 1944, she somehow escaped being killed, only to be forced on a death march and relocated to Ravensbruck and then Malchow. She survived typhus and eventually emigrated to Israel. By 1952, she and her husband and daughter had settled in Montreal. Also a survivor of Auschwitz, Toby Elisabet R., from Slovakia, was eventually transferred with her sisters to the concentration camp known as Stutthof. She barely survived a death march in 1945 when she was shot and left for dead. Also included are the narratives of two sisters, Use Z. and Marti D. who grew up in Amsterdam, where they belonged to the same synagogue as the Frank family. They managed to avoid deportation until 1943 but were soon after deported to Bergen-Belsen. It was here in 1945 that Marti recalls speaking to Anne Frank across the barriers that divided their Lagers. At the end of the war, the sisters returned to Amsterdam only to be shunned by their neighbors, a fate not unlike that of many Jews returning to the Netherlands. All of these women as well as many others commented that they had difficulty speaking of their experiences but they felt they owed it to their children as well as future generations. For many, the Living Testimonies project gave them their first opportunity to share their stories in a supportive environment. Men who survived the camps shared experiences similar to their female counterparts. David A., for example, was born in Hungary and recruited for service in a labor battalion in 1943. After escaping and being recaptured, he was sent to BaIf, a village in the Austro-Hungarian border where sixty percent of the prisoners perished from 1944 to 1945. David was shot and left for dead in what was to be a mass grave only to be rescued hours later by Russian soldiers. Another story is that of Israel B. from Poland, who by 1940 had been moved into the ghetto along with his family. By 1942, the ghetto had been liquidated and all were deported to Treblinka. Israel managed to hide in the ghetto for a while but was eventually captured and sent to a gunpowder factory near Pionki. He eventually landed in Sachsenhausen and was led on a death march. Surviving this was no small miracle, and by 1948, Israel and his new family arrived in Montreal. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2009}, {\"paperId\": \"2dcbc0f8943526cbfd272a7bed060d6c1dbb633b\", \"title\": \"Bert Dan interview\", \"abstract\": \"An interview with Bert Dan, a Holocaust \\\\nsurvivor, conducted by Kay Roth.

Focusing on a case study of a town in southern Poland, Mszana Dolna, the study analyses how Jewish/non-Jewish relations and the history of the Jews of the town are remembered by the current inhabitants of Mszana, as well as by Holocaust survivors and their families. The research is based on an interdisciplinary approach to the subject of memory, using in depth oral history interviews, archival and other written materials, as well as participant observation as sources of analysed data. The study concentrates on the memory of the life in Mszana before, during and after the war in terms of the coexistence of two communities, Jewish and non-Jewish ones. Focusing mainly on the annual commemoration of the shooting of the Jews of Mszana in August 1942 by non-Jewish members of the community and their participation in the educational programmes, the research elucidates the process of regaining the Jewish heritage of the town by non-Jewish inhabitants and incorporating it into the past of the community of Mszana. Identifying the variety of levels of interactions between Jews and non-Jews before the war, it argues that the interrupted coexistence of both groups in Mszana resulted in the void which remained after the destroyed Jewish community. The memory of Jews found its place in the oral history for several decades. Through examining the forms of remembrance of the Jews in Mszana, this study attempts to illustrate the transition of the memory of Jews from private sphere of life to the public discourse on the Jewish inheritance of the town.\", \"year\": 2016}, {\"paperId\": \"2e6052bcd91dd566233202a8e38f3ba7f3f1d94c\", \"title\": \"Holocaust Writing of the Second Generation\", \"abstract\": null, \"year\": 2007}, {\"paperId\": \"2ed36e0314b74364fe0b6d3a077d40a0085ae277\", \"title\": \"Transcending Time to Redeem Humanity: Human Rights Education and the Holocaust\", \"abstract\": \"This article presents the results of a qualitative, phenomenological case study focused on teachers\\' percep- tions about human rights education in light of the Holocaust.

All three emphasize the impact of one\\\\u2019s own family\\\\u2019s past and present on the deeply personal process of scripting and drawing the stories: Libicki\\\\u2019s and Seliktar\\\\u2019s grandparents were Holocaust survivors; Yelin\\\\u2019s grandfather was a member of the SS. Importantly, all three artists have small children, which helped them deepen their connection with their subjects\\\\u2019 childhood personas. But I Live is a work of impressive scope. Given how central the visual and testimonial material is to this book, however, I wish the authors had tackled the specificity of such sources in more detail in the Afterword. For example, it is not entirely accurate that \\\\u201c[m]ost of the visual documentary and documents [sic] we have from the Holocaust are documents produced by perpetrators\\\\u201d (179). In fact, there is ample visual material produced by concentration camp prisoners and Holocaust survivors, including children, that survives to this day.

As documented by her own writings, by newly published interviews with former students surviving the Holocaust, and by the surviving artwork of children impris oned in Terezin, she used art lessons to improve the quality of life for her students. This article on Dicker-Brandeis is fourfold: 1) to draw par allels between her art education methods and those of Cizek and Itten; 2) to establish her as a progressive educator interested in the whole child; 3) to demonstrate close parallels between her progressive education methods and those of Florence Cane and Natalie Robinson Cole in the United States and Marion Richardson in Great Britain; and 4) to establish her as a Holo caust art educator who brought progressive art education to the children in Terezin. Friedl Dicker-Brandeis (1898-1944), a Bauhaus-trained Jewish artist and art edu cator, who taught art to children in Terezin, a Nazi ghetto camp, provides a powerful legacy of an art educator working under the most heinous conditions during World War II (Makarova, 2001; Hurwitz, 1991). As a ghetto camp located in what is now the Czech Republic 40 miles northwest of Prague, Terezin (also known by its Ger man nameTheresienstadt) was essentially used as a deportation stop for Czech Jews in transit to the death camps in the East. Dicker-Brandeis, along with other inmates trained in arts and letters, created and sustained a rich cultural life in the ghetto camp, including scheduled schooling for the incarcerated children (Hellerstein 1991; Milton, 2000). Her teaching and her life were cut short when she, along with so many other adults and children from Terezin, were transported to Auschwitz, a Nazi death camp, and killed in the gas chambers. Friedl Dicker-Brandeis\\'s legacy of ped agogy can be analyzed through letters and lectures that she wrote, what survivors from Terezin remember about her teach ing, and through the surviving children\\'s artwork, carried out in two suitcases after liberation by Willy Groag, a leader of one of the children\\'s homes (Makarova, 2001). Dicker-Brandeis\\'s art lessons were influ enced by her own training, first by Franz Cizek, whose classes she had attended in Vienna as a youth, and afterwards by her studies with Johannes Itten and other Mas ters of Form at the Bauhaus (1919-1923). The purpose of this article is fourfold: 1) to draw parallels between the art education methods of Dicker-Brandeis in Terezin and those of Cizek and Itten, thus demonstrat ing their influence; 2) to establish Dicker Brandeis as a progressive educator whose interest in the whole child was fostered by Cizek and Itten; 3) to demonstrate that Dicker-Brandeis\\'s pedagogy closely par allels the progressive education methods used by her contemporaries, specifically Florence Cane and Natalie Robinson Cole in the United States, and Marion Richard son in Great Britain; and 4) to establish Friedl Dicker-Brandeis historically as a Holocaust art educator who brought pro gressive art education to the children in Terezin. 92 VISUAL ARTS RESEARCH ? 2006 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois This content downloaded from 157.55.39.143 on Wed, 15 Jun 2016 06:26:40 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\", \"year\": 2006}, {\"paperId\": \"319e46596e9753657c708ea09da798e5f714d896\", \"title\": \"Summative Analysis: A Qualitative Method for Social Science and Health Research\", \"abstract\": \"In this paper the author describes a new qualitative analytic technique that she has been perfecting across a range of health research studies.

First, they experienced the woods as a disorienting, alien, and alienating world, and yet an escape from a more corrupt world outside the forest.

It reports on an exploratory study that examines: the criteria searchers of oral history interviews use when judging the relevance of a recording or a passage; the attributes on which those judgments are based; the moves searchers adopt for information need refinements (INR); and the types of query reformulation by which those moves are realized. Eight participants that include faculty, Holocaust scholars, a film producer, and a high school teacher searched the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation\\'s collection that consists of 116,000 hours of 52,000 testimonies in 32 different languages from the survivors, liberators, rescuers and witnesses of the Holocaust. Each participant performed a series of searches based on his/her own interests over a period of three to nine days. Data were collected through observation and screen capture, think aloud, semi-structured interviews, and focus group discussions; coded; and analyzed by looking for patterns. The cognitive process of relevance judgment and query reformulation occurred interactively during a search. As a result, some relevance criteria (topicality, comprehensibility, novelty of content, and acquaintance) and INR moves (clarification alone, specialization, restriction, and note for later) were observed during both processes. Some criteria, such as richness and emotion, were medium (i.e., speech) and domain (i.e., oral history) specific. The findings identified four different types of attributes of a recording or a passage that included spoken-content attributes (person, place, event/experience, organization/group, ...), audio and/or visual attributes (facial expression, voice, gesture, displayed artifact, ...), non-content attributes (cache, digitization, language, ...), and biographical attributes (name of interviewee, date of birth, gender, occupation, ...).

Those \\\\u201cmixed-race\\\\u201d Germans were sterilized after the Nazis came to power and many died in concentration camps. This is one of the few accounts of the fate of Blacks not only in Germany proper but also in the pre-World War I colonies. The only other book that has engaged the subject is by Hans J. Massaquoi, Destined to Witness: Growing Up Black in Nazi Germany, a memoir about growing up in Hamburg as an Afro-German in the Nazi era. However, Bil\\\\u00e9, a journalist for RFO, creates a very readable account that joins together pieces of the German experience in Africa and with Africans. Using interviews with Black survivors, Bil\\\\u00e9 has created an engaging text, although one that is thin on analysis. Germany\\\\u2019s first bad experiences came with its African colonies, principally German Southwest Africa (Namibia), German East Africa, Togo, and Cameroon. Namibia was the site of the first documented genocide of the twentieth century when General von Trotha ordered the extermination of the native Herero and Nama peoples after a failed uprising. This is a genocide which the Federal Republic of Germany recognized in 2006 and is the subject of much scholarly interest. However, Bil\\\\u00e9\\\\u2019s analysis reveals other aspects of the many problems that developed in the German colonial experience because of a parallel development of race theory. This ideology of racial purity for whites created considerable opposition by colonial officials and even missionaries about mixed marriages and mixed-race births. Although Germany lost all of its colonies by the terms of the Versailles Treaty, the rise of race theory and eugenics ultimately created what German doctors feared would be a public health menace. When Hitler came to power, all mixed marriages between \\\\u201cAryans\\\\u201d and other races were forbidden and existing marriages annulled. As with the case of Jewish persecution, Black Germans were excluded from schools and youth movements. Forced sterilization of mixed-race blacks intensified under Sonderkommando 3 in 1937. When World War II started, the incarceration processes affected non-German Blacks, such as the American musician Arthur Briggs, interned after the occupation of France at Saint Denis, The presence of Black American GIs in allied armies scared the Nazis so much that the rules of the Geneva Convention were violated by a long list of summary executions. However, there were some exceptions. Josef Nassy, a Black artist born in Surinam and a naturalized American, was detained in the camp at Laufen, was not persecuted, and was allowed to paint. Nassy and all of his art survived, now in the collection of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Bil\\\\u00e9\\\\u2019s book is filled with countless stories of Blacks, especially with a French colonial nationality connection, who wound up in concentration camps, often to live to tell the tale. One wishes these accounts might be longer because of the countries of origin of some of these victims: Haiti, Martinique, Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea, and Congo. Within this strange world of camps, Bil\\\\u00e9 has two interesting stories, one of Blanchette, the only black woman deported to Ravensbr\\\\u00fcck, and Hugo, a Black Kapo in Auschwitz. Bil\\\\u00e9 ends his account on a high note, with the stories of American Black GI\\\\u2019s who were involved in the liberation of some concentration camps but also fought in a segregated army.\", \"year\": 2007}, {\"paperId\": \"34e4aa26c8003a955061d3453d885668f02ab0a1\", \"title\": \"Recovering and rendering silenced experiences of genocides: Testimonial fragments of the Holocaust\", \"abstract\": \"\\\\n The experiences of murdered victims of Nazi persecutions perished with them.

To date, Buber Agassi has recovered the identity of over 16,000 Ravensbruck prisoners.

In 2003 he famously debated Tarik Ramadan, a Swiss academic who is a grandson of Hassan el Banna, founder of the Muslim Brotherhood. In the debate, Ramadan accused Finkielkraut of Islamophobia and \\\\\"communautarism,\\\\\" (a euphemism for Jewish tribalism). Often reviled for his openly pro-Israeli views and his concern for the negative impact of immigration on French culture and identity, Finkielkraut is now at the center of a media storm following the recent publication of his latest book The Unhappy Identity. This volume considers the national identity of France, the country in which Finkielkraut was born and raised. A week prior the publication of The Unhappy Identity, the mainstream weekly, Le Point, devoted the cover and most of its issue to this philosopher.2 In the same issue Ghaleb Bencheikh, former president ofthe Great Mosque ofParis who today chairs the \\\\\"World Conference of Religions for Peace\\\\\" and hosts the television show \\\\\"&/In addition to having been interviewed widely by the media, Finkielkraut also has been insulted and subjected to violent rants because of what is perceived as his scathing attack on immigration, and more specifically on Muslim immigration. Yet this is not what the book is about. While it cannot be denied that the philosopher sees in that immigration the seeds of destruction for French culture, his view is not related to the religion of the immigrants; rather, it related to his belief that they refuse to be integrated into the fabric of French society and that they are destroying it from within. Popular French journalist Frederic Martel unfairly quipped that Unhappy Identity is in fact \\\\\"...the unhappy book of a man who no longer likes himself.3\\\\\" That is not true. Finkielkraut is indeed unhappy, but that is because he mourns the disintegration of the country that he knows and loves, that is, the loss of its traditions and its values. In a nostalgic introduction, Finkielkraut writes of his youth in post-war France and the great expectations of May 1968, when students shared the heady belief that they could change the world. He mourns what he sees as contemporary loss of hope, and also that France is changing in a manner opposed to the will of its native population. Europe, he says, is becoming \\\\\"A continent of immigration...Change is no longer what we are doing or what we are aspiring to, change is what is happening to us ... and what is happening... is the integration crisis.\\\\\"4Integration-or rather the lack of it-and its impact on French tradition and culture forms the core of the book, whose six chapters are replete with quotations ranging from Hobbes to Tocqueville, Levy-Strauss, and Barres to Hanna Arendt. The new immigrants insist on observing their religion in public spaces even when doing so is illegal. In fact, says Finkielkraut, \\\\\"For the first time in the history of immigration, those who are hosted refused to those who host themwhoever they may be - the right to represent the host country.5\\\\\"Finkielkraut considers that this development would not have taken place without some unlikely supporters who saw the intrusion of religion and religious practices in everyday life from an unexpected angle. In his view, it started with a clash of ideas between two groups of secular thinkers. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2013}, {\"paperId\": \"371cde822dc42cdfd8849f7a18b3c41b6454751d\", \"title\": \"Simon Kalmas (Shimon Yosef Kalmus) Interview\", \"abstract\": \"An interview with Simon J.

However, their works are further distinguished by acute examinations that probe the moral fabric of Israeli society itself, including dehumanization of the enemy through slogans and other debased forms of language and misuses of historical memory. In addition, their fiction measures the distance between the suffering and pain of intimate family memory (what Semel once dubbed their \\\\u201cprivate Shoah\\\\u201d) and ceremonial, nationalistic forms of Holocaust memory, and the apartness felt by the children of survivors who sense themselves somehow at odds with their society\\\\u2019s heroic values. Semel\\\\u2019s numerous articles, and fiction as well as nonfiction books, frequently address second and third-generation trauma, arguably most impressively in her harrowing five-part novel And the Rat Laughed (2001) that spans 150 years but most crucially juxtaposes the experiences of a \\\\u201chidden child\\\\u201d in a remote wartime Polish village repeatedly raped with that of her grandchild writing a dutiful report for her class in contemporary Israel.

Based on empirical data, I want to provide a closer look at these specific stressors. About the background: According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), there are currently nearly 26.4 million refugees, about half of them are under the age of 18. A majority of them have been exposed to multiple traumatic experiences, such as internal displacement, extreme violence, and torture. Meeting the needs of this vulnerable group is a major challenge for host countries and is often covered by professional helpers or volunteers. Since helpers are repeatedly confronted with severe trauma of the primary victims, they often are affected themselves. The effect of secondary trauma stress is already established in scientific literature and documented in the DSM-5. What is still lacking in terms of conceptualization are two main aspects: Firstly, traumatized refugees do not only suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) but their traumatization is much more complex. Clinical trauma research often runs the risk to cut the consequences of war and flight too short. According to this, I would like to introduce the concept of sequential traumatization as an alternative approach for understanding traumatization in this context. Originally coming from a study of holocaust survivors, it describes trauma as an ongoing and long-lasting process and thus contrasts with the concept of post-traumatic stress disorder. Among other aspects the formulation of sequential traumatization integrates decreased resilience, cultural as well as socio-economical aspects of trauma. And secondly, refugee helpers are therefore not only confronted with primary victim PTSD, but also the more complex form of sequential trauma. That means, their stressors cannot be separated from a range of socio-political and societal conditions. The Helpers may face secondary sequential traumatic stress (SSTS). Our research question focuses on these specific stressors caused by confrontation with sequential trauma. Eighteen interviews were conducted with supporters in the context of flight and asylum. According to our results helpers have to deal with fears, excessive demands as well as with feelings of guilt, ambiguities of hope and despair and the endurance of uncertainty and injustice. In addition to empathy and direct confrontation with trauma, it is above all social approaches and political decisions that make supporters feel angry, powerless and helpless in the context of war, flight and, asylum.\\\\\"\", \"year\": 2022}, {\"paperId\": \"3c948c7b0cd2292cdb58e824eb35e1a8cb6f9bca\", \"title\": \"\\\\\"You\\'ve Never Seen this Kind of Poverty\\\\\": Facing Class and Gender in Shoah Representations\", \"abstract\": \"In researchers\\' reconstructions of the Holocaust, also called the Shoah, the lives of ordinary people l lives more impoverished and constrained than those of middle- and upper-class individuals - have been largely overlooked.

Thomas Sandk\\\\u00fchler\\\\u2019s and Dieter Pohl\\\\u2019s works on the German administration in Galicia and Christian Gerlach\\\\u2019s massive study of German occupation policies in Belorussia offer some of the most outstanding examples. Likewise, Wendy Lower\\\\u2019s first-rate study of the Zhytomyr region provides an important contribution to the existing scholarship and serves as a welcome complement to Karel Berkhoff\\\\u2019s work on Ukraine. In addition to incorporating a broad range of secondary sources, Lower expertly leverages an impressive collection of primary sources: local Ukrainian archival holdings, memoirs and diaries, interviews conducted with survivors of the German occupation, and materials from captured German document collections and former Soviet archives. The author\\\\u2019s command of this literature makes it possible for her to present a detailed and nuanced picture of the occupation in the Zhytomyr region during the period 1941\\\\u20131944, including the everyday experiences of Jews, non-Jewish Ukrainians, the ethnic German population, and the various agencies and organizations of the German administration. Her depiction of the issues, challenges, opportunities, and dangers faced by each of these groups at the grass-roots level constitutes one of the major strengths of the work. Despite her focus on the expression of National Socialist rule in the Zhytomyr region, Lower also traces the relationship of specific Nazi initiatives in the region to their broader historical and contemporary influences. On the one hand, Lower argues that Hitler\\\\u2019s conception of Ukraine as a \\\\u201cGarden of Eden\\\\u201d or the \\\\u201cCalifornia of Europe\\\\u201d must be seen through the prism of a long tradition of European imperialism.

On the other hand, Lower describes the ways in which German administrators, the Wehrmacht, and SS and police authorities on the periphery pursued the goals and objectives emanating from the center. While Adolf Hitler, Heinrich Himmler, and Reinhard Heydrich established policy aims and constructed an administrative apparatus to achieve them, \\\\u201cthe process of persecution and methods of mass murder developed from the ground up\\\\u201d (p. 158).

Le Vine Emeritus, Washington University in St. Louis First, in the interest of full disclosure and in deference to the authors of this essay, I admit to having reviewed the article last year and advising the editors of the African Studies Review not to publish it. I do, however, applaud their decision to make it available-with minor revisions by the authors-for open discussion in these pages and therefore agreed to add my comments to those of other reviewers. Two considerations prompted my negative review: one was what I saw were shortcomings in the analysis due to a failure to address the larger contextual issues raised by the original question, and the other, the willingness of the authors, in my view unwarranted, to accept the conjunction of Jewish Holocaust reparations with the demands for reparations for slavery and colonialism. My reading of the revised manuscript confirmed my earlier judgment, particularly with reference to the latter problem, raising serious questions about the authors\\' analytic logic and arguments. My comments focus on these matters. The authors are certainly correct in concluding that success in reparations claims \\\\\"depends to large extent on how the claim for reparations is framed.\\\\\" They then proceed to point out that the Jewish claims were successful because the event from which claims arose was comparatively recent, that survivors of the Holocaust, or members of their immediate families, or the families of victims, were/are present to make the claims; that appeals for compensatory justice resonated with those with strong moral convictions about genocide-or with residual feelings of guilt about the event. (It should be added the Holocaust itself, as a unique event, had a worldwide audience, at least after the end of World War II, to whom the appeal could be directed.) So far so good. The problem is that the original question, put as \\\\\"Why Africans can\\'t imitate Jews?\\\\\" and also as \\\\\"Why did the Jews obtain reparations, yet we can\\'t?\\\\\" is itself a complex loaded question (in logic, it begs the question) which presupposes definite answers to a previous set of unstated, loaded questions, such as (here), Q: \\\\\"Is the Holocaust the moral equivalent of slavery, or colonialism?\\\\\" A: Yes. Q. \\\\\"Are not Africans as worthy of compensation for their collective injury, as were the Jews for theirs?\\\\\" A: Yes. Q: \\\\\"Should the Jews be privileged in getting reparations over Africans demanding compensation for the injury they suffered? A: No. All of these unstated questions and answers (which can also be restated as unstated premises) are worth examining on their own merits for the attitudes they imply and the historical-ideological context(s) in which they were raised. That is not, however, the analytical path taken by the authors: they accept the original question as their point of departure without looking at its implications or premises. In short, the original question, used as die conundrum for investigation, violates at least one canon of scientific inquiry: you cannot use a loaded question as the basis of analysis, at least not until it is rephrased without its hidden overload. Without losing the import of the authors\\' argument, or vitiating their conclusions, how could the issues they raise be put as a valid question(s) for analysis? For example, \\\\\"How have African demands for reparations been framed, and why?\\\\\" \\\\\"Can Jewish claims for Holocaust reparations be compared to African claims involving slavery and colonialism? If so, how? If not, why not?\\\\\" Once stated without its load, the main question could then subsume reasonable discussion of the comparative success (or lack thereof) of the Holocaust and \\\\\"black\\\\\" reparations campaigns. One further reservation directed at the authors\\' methodology. This study is based on \\\\\"seventy-five interviews with African ambassadors, academics, policymakers, and human rights activists, many [of whom] indicated awareness of the precedent of reparations to Jews. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2007}, {\"paperId\": \"3d94b8433072adc4957bbe8075dc8cd08b5750a0\", \"title\": \"Psychiatry, Testimony, and Shoah\", \"abstract\": \"Summary A1999 examination of approximately 5000 long-term psychiatric patients in Israel identified 725 as Holocaust (Shoah) survivors.

Since the 1980s, researchers working on Sephardic and Mizrahi (Eastern) Jewry during the Holocaust in the Balkans, North Africa and Iraq have published much on the inclusion of the non-Ashkenazi Jews in diverse aspects of annihilation, resistance, and hiding. Due to the lack of awareness, proximity to Israeli Holocaust museums, and large groups of survivors outside of Israel, very little research and interviewing was done on Sephardic and Mizrahi Jewry in WWII and the exposure of the Jews of the Balkans, North Africa, the Middle East and the Far East to the Holocaust. In this process, the Holocaust history of Morocco and Iraq was virtually known outside of Israel. Since for many decades after the Holocaust Ashkenazi hegemony emphasized heroism and resistance in its narrative, when Sephardic research addressed Jewish partisan resistance in the Balkans, and in Auschwitz and other labor and death camps, it was blocked from the general historiography and museum commemoration. In the last two decades, the Holocaust establishment has been including Sephardic Jewry and other non-Ashkenazi groups in Africa and Asia in its narrative at best as a token element. In ex-Yugoslavia, the Jasenovac death camp has reduced portrayal of its Jewish victims to a minimum in defense of Croatan nationalist cover-up; in Serbia Holocaust commemoration has not progressed beyond socialist realism representing Jewish annihilation in passing; in the new Skopje museum much of the new Sephardic and Holocaust content has been censored by the government; and Bulgaria continues to deny its role in the annihilation of Jews in Macedonia and Thrace.

The chaplains were among the first liberators to meet the survivors in Europe and to send reports to American Jews. This information, supplemented by accounts from American soldiers and journalists helped shape American Jewish response to the former victims. Grobman documents the activities of chaplains in responding to the desperate needs of postwar Jewish refugees. Although the U.S. Army was responsible for the welfare of the survivors, the army did not always understand the problems of Jewish survivors, and the chaplains mediated with official military bodies to meet those needs. In addition to offering spiritual guidance, providing food, and escorting refugees to better conditions and, eventually to Palestine, the chaplains informed American authorities and the American Jewish community about the plight of displaced persons and helped organize the displaced persons as an independent political force. This critical and controversial study examines not only the adequacy of the response by the U.S. government and military to the survivors, but also the American Jewish response. Grobman concludes that the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC), the Jewish organization most responsible for providing aid to the survivors, did not adequately respond. Both the failure of the American Jewish community to donate sufficient funds to the JDC and of American Jewish social workers to volunteer in significant numbers for duty as JDC representatives in Europe, severely hampered rescue efforts.

Biographical narrative interviews be they focused on the \\'Third Reich\\' or on life history produce long, epic and dramatic stories about war. The Second World War is still undoubtedly a private as well as a public theme which is frequently and easily expanded upon, with seemingly few problems of memory. One explanation of this phenomenon is that important and widely experienced historical events, or phases which have had extreme and painful effects upon the everyday lives of people in a certain region or country, generate narration. Common experience and suffering leads it is assumed to the formation of groups in which common stories and myths are traditionalized. Where this process has occurred, as we will assume it did for World War n, then it is possible to externalize former suffering, to distance oneself from it and to cause the pain to recede into the background, possibly with the help of anecdotes.1 Yet although the narration-generative effect of the collective suffering and experience of World War II has an empirical basis,2 it is quite impossible to maintain this assumption in general. While it may be possible to argue that some sort of togetherness is created by narrators,3 the converse assumption that togetherness produces narration applies only to specific structures of experience. In fact, two empirical examples show by contrast that painful events which are commonly experienced can become inexpressible. For many people who were persecuted by the National Socialists, who were in hiding during WW II or were forced into ghettos, or who survived concentration and extermination camps, a great deal of effort is necessary for remembering and narration. Since their liberation, a few have spoken frequently of their experiences, but the vast majority have tried to forget. Among those who are beginning to speak now, and who are trying to remember the crimes committed against them, many have narration gaps and are almost completely unable to give themselves over to a stream of narration or to a re-living of experience. While the narration difficulties of these people are partly due to the traumatization they have undergone, another factor is revealed by analysis of the narrations of bystanders and perpetrators of national socialism: the partial speechlessness of the victims contrasts to the verbosity of the non-persecuted German, whose narrations serve, paradoxically, not to uncover the injustice of the national socialist system and their own involvement in it, but to cover it up with stories. Holocaust survivors, on the other hand, want to talk about their traumatic experiences as a reaction against tendencies to forget Nazi crimes, and against the thesis of the 4Auschwitz-Lie\\', but their experiences are so much more difficult to relate. For persecuted and non-persecuted Germans the possibilities of narration about the period of National Socialism depend upon different, and differently realisable, social functions of remembering. My second example is that of veterans of World War I who say hardly anything about their experiences in the trenches. Common soldiers who had little part in the creation of the literature of the war are especially notable for speaking very little about their time at the front.4 WW I in no way resembles WW II in the generation of narration. The presentation of the former in speech is confined to images, metaphors and limited reports about personal experiences.5 The difference in the verbal presentation of the two wars is connected to differences in the conditions for experience of the wars, and above all to the contrast between a war of immobility and a war of mobility. In this article I wish to discuss the thesis that the narrability of WW II that is, the structural possibility of generating narrations about the war experience during the period of National Socialism, and the accompanying readiness to narrate is conditional upon the structure of the war experience, the biographical necessity for narration, and its social function for the Germans. My argument is based on analyses of biographical narrations which were gained in various projects.6 In one collective project, \\'Biographical Working Through of War Experiences\\', my colleagues and I examined 21 non-persecuted witnesses of the Third Reich born in the years 1890-1930. 7 1 will also consider another 15 interviews I conducted with men\", \"year\": 2016}, {\"paperId\": \"406265a65c4613c12a96c0d05d32a1adf080e91d\", \"title\": \"Implications of the Holocaust for eating and weight problems among survivors\\' offspring: an exploratory study\", \"abstract\": \"This paper explores the proposition that Holocaust survivors\\' experiences of deprivation and trauma influenced the development of eating and weight problems among their offspring.

What is less known is how the genocide affected the offspring of these survivors. From my own interviews with members of the Armenian-American \\\\u201csecond generation,\\\\u201d many of whom are now in their 80s and 90s (those born in the 1920s and 1930s), and my examination of the few scholarly articles that have delved into this issue, I argue that there was indeed a transfer of trauma from one generation to the next. In addition, I argue that the extensive scholarship within the Jewish community, both in Israel and in the Jewish diaspora, on how the Holocaust has impacted the offspring of that genocide, can teach us much about the transgenerational passing of trauma with regard to the Armenian Genocide. Finally, I examine how the issue of genocide denial has also impacted the second generation. Survivors of the Armenian Genocide were generally women and children, as men were the first to be killed (either while they were conscripts in the Ottoman Army or in their ancestral villages in the Armenian Plateau or in other parts of Anatolia). Survivors, particularly those who endured the forced exile march to the Syrian Desert, endured beatings and rape, witnessed family members brutally killed by gendarmes or \\\\u201cchetes\\\\u201d\\\\u2014criminals set loose on the caravans\\\\u2014and saw remaining family members die of starvation or dehydration. Those who survived these death marches were able to settle in the Arab countries, or emigrate chiefly to France, the United States, or various countries in South America after the end of World War I. Tens of thousands of such survivors were able to come to the shores of America between the end of the war in 1918 and 1924, at which time discriminatory immigration laws were imposed on people coming from certain \\\\u201cundesirable\\\\u201d regions like Southern and Eastern Europe and the Middle East.

Color. $440.00, sale of video or DVD. $125.00, rental of video.\", \"abstract\": \"In this intriguing film, Esdier Hoffenberg, a French Jewish director, attempts to understand her mother\\'s past life. Although Eva Lamprecht was born in Poland, her family was German. Eva\\'s father, Alexander, owned a large paper factory in Sosnowiec; he continued to run die factory during the Nazi years. After the war, Eva married Stas, ajewish survivor, and converted to Judaism; she did so, the film notes, with all the \\\\\"rigor of her Protestant upbringing.\\\\\" The couple moved to France. There, Eva essentially buried her German past. But in the 1970s, Eva had repeated nervous breakdowns. The film argues diat Eva\\'s mental illness resulted from being ashamed of her German heritage. In order to understand her mother\\'s illness, Hoffenberg set out to learn about Eva\\'s early life. She recorded her mother\\'s vague recollections. She interviewed relatives and friends who had known Eva in Poland. She sifted through many family documents, including old letters, family photo albums, and home movies. In die film, Hoffenberg is quite creative in presenting these family artifacts. At times, for example, she runs a magnifying glass over old photos so that they appear to be in motion. Hoffenberg, however, is not free of Holocaust cliches; she tape-records her mother while they are traveling on a train. What did Hoffenberg learn? As a young woman, Eva was \\\\\"beautiful\\\\\" and \\'Vibrant,\\\\\" a real head turner. She led a life typical of Germans in Nazi-occupied Poland: she went to a German school, sang the Horst Wessel song, and served in the Reichsarbeitsdienst. Toward the end of the war, she worked closely with her father in the paper factory. The Lamprechts were complicit with the Nazis in the sense that they kept their factory open during the German occupation. But diey did not participate in the Nazis\\' more heinous crimes. What caused Eva\\'s illness? The film offers a few hints that Eva was preoccupied with Nazi crimes during the postwar years. At one point, for example, she went to considerable lengdis to determine the camps in which a Jewish high school friend had been imprisoned. But the film gives few other examples of Eva being obsessed with the German occupation or die Holocaust. Instead, the material presented suggests that Eva\\'s mental condition may have been caused by the many family traumas she experienced. Before the war, her mother, Gisela, a sculptress, had a love affair with a close family friend. During the war, Eva lost both her brother Lolek and her sister Nina. After die war, Gisela left both Alexander and Poland; Alexander, however, stayed in Sosnowiec. Eva had always been her father\\'s favorite, but after the war she had litde contact with him. Alexander even disinherited Eva shordy before his death in 1963\\\\u2014supposedly because she had married ajew. In France, Eva led the typical, isolated life of a middle-class wife. While her husband worked as an electrical engineer, she took care of their four children. As if all this were not enough, Eva\\'s oldest daughter died of breast cancer in 1983 (well after Eva first exhibited signs of serious depression). Certainly, Eva\\'s life was inexorably shaped by events rooted in the Nazi era. But did her inability to master her German past unleash her mental illness? Or were her wrenching family losses to blame? Eva never comes into focus in this film. Her words are vague; the picture and movies often grainy; she never looks directly at her daughter. This is, of course, in keeping with the film\\'s theme. As one interviewee stated, Eva always remained behind a \\\\\"hidden curtain.\\\\\" Who was the real Eva? We do not know. And the same is true of much else: Did Eva have something to hide about her German past? Did she ever resolve the issues of her past? Why did Alexander stay in Poland? Why did he disinherit Eva? This film beautifully documents the twists and turns of a life shaped by the upheaval of mid-twentieth-century Europe. But die film\\'s main contention\\\\u2014that Eva\\'s shame about her first life brought on the mental illness of her second\\\\u2014is open to question. Ultimately, The Two Lives of Eva is more evocative dian convincing: it may have happened that way, but it may just as well have not.\", \"year\": 2007}, {\"paperId\": \"432bcf27fdc0d97236137551f506dd1607a85d8d\", \"title\": \"The Experience of Being a Hidden Child Survivor of the Holocaust\", \"abstract\": \"Child survivors of the Holocaust have only recently been recognized as a distinguishable group of individuals who survived the war with a different experience to the older survivors. This thesis focuses on a specific group of child survivors, those who survived by going into hiding. In hiding, some remained \\\\u201cvisible\\\\u201d by hiding within convents, orphanages or with Christian families. Others were physically hidden and had to disappear from sight. Most children often combined these two experiences in their hiding. The intent of this study was to explore the experience of these hidden children using Giorgi\\\\u2019s empirical phenomenological methodology and to gain a richer understanding of the nature of this experience. Phenomenological analyses of the recorded and transcribed interviews of 11 child survivors were conducted and organized into meaning units which subsequently yielded situated structures from which the general structures evolved. These analyses revealed that the defining moment of being hidden for these children was the suppression of their identities as Jews. By being hidden, they had to deny the essence of their core selves, including their names, family details and connections to others in an effort to conceal their Jewishness. Other structures to emerge as part of hiding were the pervading fear which enveloped their entire experience in hiding and the sense of suspended normality during this period, which sometimes extended over a period of years. A \\\\u201ccut-offness\\\\u201d and personality constriction seemed to be present throughout the descriptions of these children and appears to have developed as a method of coping with the trauma of their childhood. Overlaying all of this were general insecurities about the capriciousness of the war and the contextual specifics of their actual hiding places to which each child had to adjust. Connections/relationships to another person seemed to be highly significant in the dynamics of the everyday during the experience of hiding and often shaped some of the psychological and emotional experiences of hiddenness.\", \"year\": 2009}, {\"paperId\": \"43485768e7b078de500c705906537cee48746b84\", \"title\": \"Jm\\\\u00e9no: jeho zm\\\\u011bna, ztr\\\\u00e1ta a navr\\\\u00e1cen\\\\u00ed v rozhovorech s \\\\u017eidovsk\\\\u00fdmi p\\\\u0159e\\\\u017eiv\\\\u0161\\\\u00edmi holocaustu\", \"abstract\": \"This article aims to explore the personal name as an aspect of human identity, based on our analysis of several tens of oral-history autobiographical interviews from the USC Shoah Foundation\\\\u2019s Visual History Archive (http://vhaonline.usc.edu).

To investigate this issue, we interviewed 121 Croatian war veterans diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) about amnesia, intrusions (i.e., flashbacks and nightmares), and the sensory qualities of their most horrific war memories. Additionally, they completed a self-report scale measuring dissociative experiences. In contrast to what one would expect on the basis of theories emphasizing the special status of traumatic memories, amnesia and high frequency intrusions were not particularly typical for our sample of traumatized individuals. Moreover, traumatic memories were not qualitatively different from neutral memories with respect to their stability and sensory qualities. The severity of PTSD symptoms was not significantly correlated with dissociative experiences. Our findings do not support the existence of special memory mechanisms that are unique to experiencing traumatic events. I N T R O D U C T I O N In clinical literature, there is little consensus about how victims remember traumatic experiences (e.g., Kihlstrom, 2004; Loftus, 1997b; McNally, 2003a). According to one popular view, memories of traumatic events have special properties that distinguish them from ordinary memories. Thus, many authors have argued that traumatic memories are qualitatively different from other types of memories, involving unique mechanisms not related to general memory functioning (e.g., van der Kolk, 1996, 1997; for a review, see Zoellner & Bittenger, 2004). For example, these authors assume that traumatic events are processed in a predominantly perceptual fashion, leaving survivors with traumatic memories that are not readily accessible (i.e., dissociative or psychogenic amnesia) and/or flashbacks that possess strong sensory qualities. This dissociative style of processing would also create a substantial overlap between dissociative and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. There are several versions of this theoretical stance (Brewin, Dalgleish & Joseph, 1996; Ehlers & Clark, 2000), but the core assumption they have in common is that trauma has a special impact on the way in which memories of the traumatic event are organized. For that reason, this position has been dubbed the traumaTRAUMATIC WAR MEMORIES 37 memory argument (for a balanced discussion, see Kihlstrom, 1996, in press; Shobe & Kihlstrom, 1997; for a reply, see Nadel & Jacobs, 1998). Although the trauma-memory argument has gained popularity among many clinicians, some findings argue against this view. As Pendergrast (1998) has pointed out, classic monographs like those of Spiegel and colleagues (Grinker & Spiegel, 1943/1945; Kardiner & Spiegel, 1941/1947) include only isolated case reports of soldiers suffering from amnesia (see also Lilienfeld & Loftus, 1998). Moreover, more systematic studies suggest that only a small minority of war victims report dissociative amnesia. For example, Kuch and Cox (1992) studied 124 holocaust survivors and found that dissociative amnesia, with an estimated lifetime prevalence rate of 3.2%, was quite rare in this group. Likewise, Merckelbach and colleagues (Merckelbach, Dekkers, Wessel, & Roefs, 2003a, 2003b) found in a group of 29 Dutch concentration camp survivors only one survivor reporting mnemonic experiences that might be taken as evidence for dissociative amnesia1. Goodman and co-workers found that 15.5% of victims of documented childhood sexual abuse (CSA) failed to report the target incident during a telephone interview conducted approximately 13 years after the pertinent events (Goodman, Ghetti, Quas, Edelstein, Alexander et al., 2003; Goodman & Paz-Alonso, in press). However, nondisclosure dropped to 8.3% after follow-up by a mailed questionnaire and a telephone interview2. Both rates of reporting failure are clearly lower than those found in earlier, less meticulous studies of CSA victims (e.g., Williams, 1994). Even when one accepts these lower rates of non-reporting, the question arises to what extent they do reflect genuine dissociative amnesia. People might not report the traumatic events for other reasons than amnesia (e.g., shame, ordinary forgetting; see McNally, 2003a). Recent literature is also critical about the idea that traumatic memories invariantly produce flashbacks. For example, using patient archives, Jones and colleagues showed that flashbacks were an uncommon symptom in generations of British war veterans before the 1980\\\\u2019s (Jones, Vermaas, McCartney, Beech, Palmer et al., 2003). So far, empirical support for the trauma-memory argument is not very compelling. On the other hand, the studies cited above suffer from various shortcomings and thus, one could argue that they provide only suboptimal tests of the trauma-memory argument. One shortcoming is that it is not always clear whether the events (e.g., war experiences) were really traumatic to the participants (Jones et al., 2003). Another limitation is that the traumatic events\", \"year\": 2006}, {\"paperId\": \"43c719e6f18b4f8d9620829a3aa80eb89ae73559\", \"title\": \"\\\\u201cAs Far as They Knew I Came from France\\\\u201d: Stigma, Passing, and Not Speaking about the Holocaust\", \"abstract\": \"Today we recognize that storytelling plays an important role in helping survivors of traumatic episodes such as sexual abuse, military combat, or genocide refashion a sense of self and \\\\u201cwork through\\\\u201d their traumatic experiences.

As Dubnow was being led off to his death he said \\'shraibt, yiden, shraibt\\' (\\'write, Jews, write\\').

Although just 1% of Greece\\'s pre-war population, around one in six of the Greeks who died during the war was a Greek Jew. Barely 15% of Greek Jews survived. Until now there has only been one complete study of the Holocaust in Greece, Michael Molho and Joseph Nehama\\'s In Memoriam: Hommage aux Victims Juives des Nazis en Grece (three volumes, Salonica and Buenos Aires, 1948-1953). Molho and Nehama has been updated and translated into Greek, although the best edition is the 1965 Hebrew edition Shoat Yehudei Yavan (The Holocaust of Greek Jews, Jerusalem 1965). Thanks to Michael Matsas there is finally a book in English on the Holocaust in Greece. The Illusion of Safety is a useful contribution to the literature. The book is divided into three sections: a historical account which relies heavily on Molho and Nehama, a collection of survivors\\' and resistance fighter\\'s testimonies and Matsas\\' own personal memoir of his flight to the mountains to escape the Germans. Matsas survived by fleeing to the remote village of Psilovrahos in the mountains between Karditsa and Agrinion. Although not a professional historian, Matsas, a professional dentist, has assembled useful testimonies and material. He has undertaken some archival research in the US National Archives and has used both State Department and Organisation for Strategic Services (OSS) materials. The Illusion of Safety raises questions which professional historians have not tackled and provides materials of interest to the general reader. Matsas frequently quotes large excerpts from official documents, in contrast with the more selective use of these sources by professional historians. Matsas is refreshingly frank in discussing anti-Semitism in wartime Greece. On the basis of American archival material, Matsas argues that too many Greek Christians in Salonica were indifferent to the fate of the city\\'s Jews. A key source is the striking and troubling cable which the American Consul General in Istanbul, Burton Berry, sent back to Washington in March 1944. Berry reported an interview with four Jewish refugees who had fled Athens in mid-December 1943. According to the refugees: \\'[T]he attitude of the Greek people toward the Jews was praised in the highest terms. With the exception of the Greeks of Salonica, who are reported to have had an unsympathetic and sometimes hostile attitude toward the Jews during the persecution of 1943, the Jewish refugees pay the sincerest possible tribute of respect and admiration for the Greeks who have consistently given aid, even at the cost of tremendous sacrifices.\\' This is an important quote from an important document. The vast majority of Greek Jews lived in Salonica, some 55,000 of the 77,000 Jews in Greece before the war, making the \\'exception\\' of Salonica something which professional historians have to explain.

Having achieved independence in 1919 -- after more than a hundred years of subjugation to Russia, Prussia, and Austria -- by 1939, Poland was carved up into Soviet and Nazi spheres of domination. Poles of all stripes were rounded up, deported, tortured, and killed in both totalitarian spheres, while Polish-Jews were slated for extermination by the Nazis. By the end of the war nearly three million Poles, ten percent of the population, and three million Polish Jews, ninety percent of the Jewish population, had perished.Given their common history of victimization one could imagine that Poles and Jews would recognize their common humanity, but one would be wrong. Many Polish Jews recall the pervasive pre-war antisemitism that poisoned their lives and the wartime indifference, or worse, of their fellow Poles. They also point to the pogroms that engulfed hundreds of Holocaust survivors when they tried to return to claim their homes after the war. Itzhak Shamir, the former Prime Minister of Israel, who had been born in Poland and emigrated to Palestine as a young man, once said: \\\\\"Poles have imbibed hatred of Jews with their mothers\\' milk.\\\\\" Most Polish Jews and their descendants would sadly agree.However, most Poles view the matter quite differently. They minimize pre-war antisemitism, and they blame Jewish inability to assimilate for Polish-Jewish tensions. They argue that during the war, despite the extreme danger, thousands of Poles perished hiding or defending Jews from the Nazis. And they explain that after the war, Poland was engulfed in civil war between nationalists and communists that led to thousands of casualties, both Jewish and non-Jewish.Eva Hoffman\\'s aim in Shtetl is not to sort out these claims and counter-claims, rather it is to historicize the relationship, thereby allowing for some perspective and nuance to enter into the conversation between Poles and Jews.

In April of 2002, the Human Sciences graduate program at George Washington University, Washington, D.C., sponsored its eighth annual conference. The focus was to examine relationships among psychoanalysis, culture, and ethnography. Academic scholars from California, New York, Belgium, China, and elsewhere, gathered with many local analysts from the Washington Psychoanalytic Institute to hear keynote talks by Christiane Hartnack, Vincent Crapanzano, Paul Verhaeghe, John Kafka, and Elisabeth Young-Bruehl. We are delighted to publish some of the contributions from that conference, including papers by Daniel Rancour-Laferriere on Russian icons, jan jagodzinski on body-building, Kimberly Chabot Davis on psychoanalysis and the Birmingham tradition of audience studies, Shannon May on trauma and Chinese cinema, and Ricardo Ainslie on the repercussions of the murder of James Byrd. Ainslie and Brabeck\\\\u2019s piece, in which they interview residents of Jasper, Texas (where Byrd was killed) to understand what factors play into the heightening or containment of racial tensions, is also an excellent contribution to the declared special topic for this issue: the psychic and the social in clinical work. The papers we have assembled for this special section illuminate two aspects of this topic. First, there are a number of articles and notes that illustrate some of the ways that psychoanalytic understanding can be applied to social situations and group experiences. Among these are the articles by Ainslie and Brabeck and by Julie Oxenberg, about a project in which she worked with children of Nazis and children of Holocaust survivors. This aspect of the psychic and the social is also illustrated in the international notes by Linda Robinson, who writes about the Middle East and compares Sharon and Arafat\\\\u2019s impasse to an impasse she experienced with a couple in treatment, and by Andrew Samuels, who writes about a clinical activist group he co-founded in the UK. While all of these authors are clinicians, their focus is not on the work they do in their clinical practice but rather on how they have applied psychoanalytic thinking to larger social concerns. Susan Van Zyl\\\\u2019s paper, which suggests that public antagonism towards psychoanalysis has something to do with the enormous differences between the kind of speech and behavior that is expected of the patient on the couch and the kind expected of the citizen on the street, provides a bridge between the two different aspects of the relation between the psychic and the social we present here. As Andrew Samuels points out in his piece, the psychoanalytic left has been far more wont to apply psychoanalytic thinking to the social world than to interrogate the social in the clinical encounter itself. There are many implicit and explicit taboos about bringing socio-historical reality into the consulting room, and for most clinicians, the family is the largest social context they allow to surface in an individual treatment. If we take seriously some of the academic theoretical breakthroughs of the past ten or fifteen years, however, for example Judith Butler\\\\u2019s work on gender, Homi Bhabha\\\\u2019s work on race, Pierre Bourdieu\\\\u2019s work on class, and we look at the construction of identity as a process that in part occurs by splitting off parts of self associated with abject others, then we must at least begin to wonder how individual suffering is related to whatever individuals have split off to take their \\\\u201cproper\\\\u201d social place, even if the individuals themselves are completely unaware that their racial identity, sexual\", \"year\": 2003}, {\"paperId\": \"46623ef1d870cc6308044cd7fb8d1ac9b85237d1\", \"title\": \"Assessment of a digital intervention program with Holocaust survivors.\", \"abstract\": \"OBJECTIVE\\\\nThis study evaluated a digital intervention program with aging Holocaust survivors.

He describes a lively debate that began after the group watched the taped testimony of a woman who was an eyewitness to the Auschwitz uprising in which prisoners set fire to the camp. The woman reported four chimneys going up in flames and exploding, but historians insisted that since there was only one chimney blown up, her testimony was incorrect and should be discredited in its entirety because she proved herself an unreliable witness. One historian suggested that her testimony should be discounted because she \\\\\" ascribes importance to an attempt that, historically, made no difference \\\\\" (Felman, 1992, p. 61). The psychoanalysts responded that the woman was not testifying to the number of chimneys blown up but to something more \\\\\" radical \\\\\" and more \\\\\" crucial, \\\\\" namely, the seemingly unimaginable occurrence of Jewish resistance at Auschwitz, that is to say, the historical truth of Jewish resistance at Auschwitz. Laub concludes that what the historians could not hear, listening for empirical facts, was the \\\\\" very secret of survival and of resistance to extermination \\\\\" (Felman, 1992, p. 62).

As its title indicates, Imaginary Witness traces how Hollywood has depicted the Holocaust in feature films. Daniel Anker, who won an Oscar for his documentary Scottsboro: An American Tragedy, interweaves clips from Holocaust movies, narration by Gene Hackman, and interviews with survivors who work in the film industry like Branko Lustig and Robert Clary, directors of major Holocaust pictures like Steven Spielberg and Sidney Lumet, and scholars like Michael Berenbaum and Annette Insdorf to illustrate how the portrayal of the Shoah has evolved in Hollywood productions over the past 60 years. Anker devotes much of the documentary to the formative years of Holocaust cinema. He locates the causes of Hollywood\\'s timidity to make films critical of Hitler and Nazi anti-Semitism in the assimilationist aspirations of the Jewish movie moguls, their fear of American anti-Semitism, the financial dependence of Hollywood on the German distribution market, isolationist opposition to US intervention in European affairs, and the Production Code Administration\\'s system of self-censorship. Anker gets this story essentially right, but assigns too much blame to the Jewish movie moguls because he relies so heavily on Neil Gabler\\'s characterization of the Jewish studio owners as obsessed with proving their American identity by minimizing their Jewish one. Other film historians like Michael Birdwell and Steven Can- emphasize the external pressures the Jewish producers had to contend with: the threat that Congress would regulate the film industry if it did not censor itself, the State Department which cautioned against antagonizing Germany for diplomatic and economic reasons, the Third Reich\\'s ban on movies deemed anti-German, and the PCA whose clout stemmed from grassroots backing by Catholic and Protestant organizations. Independent anti-Nazi films like Hitler\\'s Reign of Terror and Are We Civilized? were made as early as 1934, but were never released due to Germany\\'s pressure on the Loews and MGM theatre chains. Similarly, PCA chief Joseph Breen squelched MGM\\'s plans to adapt Sinclair Lewis\\'s antifascist novel It Can\\'t Happen Here into a movie in 1935. While Imaginary Witness acknowledges that Harry Warner was one of the few producers who spoke out against Hitler, it does not explore his activities in any depth. Warner Bros, discontinued its operations in Germany in 1934 to protest the order to dismiss its Jewish employees in Germany. Since shorts and cartoons fell outside the purview of the PCA, the studio made an animated cartoon Bosko\\'s Picture Show in 1933 that parodied Hitler. The 1936 Warner Bros. production Black Legion dramatized how an anti-immigrant hate group recruited a disgruntled worker who lost a promotion to a Polish co-worker. Based on a series of ethnically, racially, and religiously motivated murders by the real Black Legion, the movie\\'s script originally featured a Jew as the target of the worker\\'s wrath, but changed his identity because the PCA threatened to withhold its seal of approval if this \\\\\"inflammatory\\\\\" plot detail remained in the final cut of the film. Breen worried that the portrayal of anti-Semitism in Warner Bros.\\' The Life of Emile Zola (1937) might provide Germany with a pretext to ban all American films from distribution in the country. In response the studio limited its reference to Alfred Dreyfus\\' Jewish heritage to a single visual allusion. The busting of an American Nazi spy ring in 1938 provided the opportunity for Warner Bros.\\' to produce Confessions of a Nazi Spy. Highlighting the dangers Nazi authoritarianism and racism posed to American democracy, the movie never mentioned anti-Semitism. Anyone cognizant of current events, however, would have recognized that these movies implicitly denounced Hitler and Nazi ideology. Although Hollywood remained hesitant about tackling the issue of Nazi anti-Semitism until the United States entered the war in late 1941, Charlie Chaplin\\'s independent production of The Great Dictator (1940) mocked Hitler as an ambitious dictator with aggressive military aims and an obsessive hatred of Jews. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2005}, {\"paperId\": \"48ccedabc821e509cad14a97f9989107826bd62d\", \"title\": \"Two boys\\\\u2014one event\", \"abstract\": \"The background of this paper is an investigation of child survivors from the Holocaust; in a study of interviews of these survivors, it could be concluded that past traumatic experiences are recovered not as memories (in the usual sense of the word), but as affects invading the present.

As Boder later commented, the device \\\\u201coffered a unique and exact means of recording the experiences of displaced persons. Through the wire recorder the displaced person could relate in his own language and in his own voice the story of his concentration camp life.\\\\u201d Studying wire- recorded narratives led him to devise a \\\\u201ctraumatic index\\\\u201d by means of which \\\\u201ceach narrative may be assessed as to the category and number of experiences bound to have a traumatizing effect upon the victim.\\\\u201d Boder\\\\u2019s 1949 monograph, I Did Not Interview the Dead, invites readers to find indications of trauma implicit in selected transcripts of recorded narratives. The premise seems to be that, to the extent that such traumatic impact exists, it should be discoverable textually. Yet the same technology that made Boder\\\\u2019s project ingenious was also the reason for its relative obscurity. Wire recording was soon to give way to tape recording, consequently condemning Boder\\\\u2019s wire spools to obsolescence and the testimonies they held to near oblivion. The short- lived medium precluded access to the recorded material.\", \"year\": 2019}, {\"paperId\": \"49e985ec77e035a33fa8ff8abc751612c033c0e6\", \"title\": \"Fresh Wounds: Early Narratives of Holocaust Survival, Edited by Donald L. Niewyk\", \"abstract\": \"Fresh Wounds: Early Narratives of Holocaust Survival, edited by Donald L. Niewyk.In 1946, American psychologist David P. Boder traveled to Europe to interview Holocaust survivors. When he returned, Boder tried to have his material published but was generally unsuccessful. Fortunately, Boder\\'s work was preserved and has now come to light in Fresh Wounds: Early Narratives of Holocaust Survival, edited by Donald L. Niewyk of Southern Methodist University. In this valuable and powerful book, Niewyk provides a sample of Boder\\'s interviews with Holocaust survivors whose ordeals were still fresh. Of Boder\\'s original 109 interviews, Niewyk has selected 34, allowing survivors from Poland, Lithuania, Germany, France, Slovakia, and Hungary to finally have their say.In his informative introduction, Niewyk details the history behind the interviews, places them in their historical context, and traces David P. Boder\\'s life. Boder\\'s interest in linguistics led him to Europe so that he could \\\\\"discover what words survivors would choose in telling their stories.\\\\\" Once there, he encountered numerous difficulties gaining access to the victims and recording their stories. Boder was limited by circumstances to refugees who for one reason or another could not return to their original homes. Thus, Jews from Italy, Greece, and most Western European countries were omitted from the process. Niewyk points out the more unique features of the narratives, emphasizing their \\\\\"special value\\\\\" and noting that they were made before the survivors\\' memories were \\\\\"blurred\\\\\" by the passage of time. Boder\\'s efforts to publish his scholarship in the 1950s essentially failed because there was no market for his product. Ironically, Boder died just as Adolf Eichmann was brought to trial. Had he lived, Boder might have received proper credit for his efforts and the public would have been exposed to the entire collection of interviews.Niewyk leaves the essence of the interviews intact, allowing the reader to feel their full impact. These accounts are special because these victims had no time to analyze or to rationalize the actions of their tormentors or, in some cases, their fellow prisoners. Nor had their anger subsided. These people did not have the luxury of having fifty years to become retrospective about their experiences. They spoke without having been exposed to material that could have enhanced their stories to make them more accurate, horrific, or marketable.The material covers every imaginable Holocaust experience. Some of the information is common knowledge, and stories of starvation, harsh conditions in the camps, and the general dehumanization process are often repeated. On the other hand, a number of the survivors had witnessed some of the most significant events of the Holocaust including the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, the revolt of the Sonderkommandos at Auschwitz, and the Slovak National uprising. Some of the accounts contain small factual errors which Niewyk corrects. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2001}, {\"paperId\": \"4bbc040c5cf2e350a5783f0a6b86b6e5ba98e01c\", \"title\": \"Rape, the Unspeakable War Crime: An Interview with Slavenka Drakulic and Juanita Wilson on the Award-Winning Filmic Rendition of as If I Am Not There\", \"abstract\": \"In the following interview, conducted in March 201 1 at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, acclaimed Croatian writer Slavenka Drakulic discusses the filmic adaptation of her 2001 novel with its director and scriptwriter, the Irish filmmaker Juanita Wilson. Based on several real life stories, As If I Am Not There (published in the USA under the title S: A Novel about the Balkans) deals with the mass rape of women in 1992 in Bosnia during the war. Alice Kuzniar, Professor of German and English as well as Chair in Croatian Studies at the University of Waterloo, leads the discussion on the choices the novelist and filmmaker make in their respective media when they represent atrocities committed against women. Given the unspeakable nature of war rape, Wilson and Drakulic address their commitment to having such suffering recognized by the international community. Even as fate as 1994-96 when he was the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, Justice Richard Goldstone assessed \\\\\"Rape has never been the concern of the international community,\\\\\" even though the 1949 Geneva Convention expressly prohibited wartime rape and enforced prostitution. There are two possible misperceptions behind this opinion: one, if rape is perceived as something personal and sexual, it is depoliticized. Two, women are seen as mere causalities of war, so that rapists are perceived as not having to be prosecuted in war crime tribunals. However, a 2001 verdict by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) stipulated that rape and sexual enslavement were crimes against humanity, challenging the widespread acceptance of rape and sexual enslavement of women as intrinsic part of war. ICTY found three Bosnian Serb men guilty of rape of women and girls (some as young as 12 and 15 years of age), in eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina. Furthermore two of the men were found guilty of the crime against humanity of sexual enslavement. It is estimated that between 20,000 and 50,000 women were raped in the war in Bosnia. As If! Am Not There tells the story of these events through the eyes of one woman\\'s horrific experiences.

The role of the social and religious set in organizing response to the Holocaust is traced. Unique dream phenomena in this group, with brief ciinical vignettes, is provided.

A detailed case history with \\'a strategic therapeutic approach is provided, and other treatment considerations are explored. The response possibilities of the system memory in traumatized individuals are outlined, and the centrality of activity-passivity conflicts in Survivors is noted. I n the autumn of 1974, following a request for assistance from a Hasidic Group in New York City, the Human Resources Administration estab- lished a Holocaust Survivor Project to provide psychological services for survivors and their children. The request for aid had come after community leaders noted an increasing occurrence of family conflicts, marital difficulties, childhood disturbances, and individual mental health crises in their people, especially among first- and second-generation survivors. As there were no trained professionals within the community concerned, an appeal was made for outside help--a step most unusual for this group, which sets a very high priority on its autonomy and privacy. The request in itself thus reflected the extent and gravity of the problem. Eventually the project was extended to serve the needs of a larger population of Orthodox and Hasidic Jews living in the city. In 1974, at the inception of the project, 762 family cases were screened and 455 families given some form of service. A trilingual questionnaire had been distributed to families in the Social Service catchment area, and a number of cases were undertaken following the response to this outreach attempt. In addition, staff members of the project, in the field at Social Service centers, had many requests for homemaking and housekeeping services from women, especially those just postpartum. In the course of interviews to attend to these requests, more cases came to light and were referred to me for discussion and consultation.\", \"year\": 1980}, {\"paperId\": \"4ddcd34842e902c641b2ec1197982f027e1ccd0d\", \"title\": \"Coping strategies in the narratives of Holocaust survivors\", \"abstract\": \"Abstract Although the memories of Holocaust survivors have been explored in a vast number of autobiographical, biographical, and clinical publications, there has been very little application of nomothetic as opposed to idiographic methodology in this area.

Refugee populations are such groups, calling for various theoretical and methodological considerations during the process of conceptualization, operationalization, sampling, and data collection. The demographics of refugees have dramatically changed since the breakdown of the former Soviet Union in the late 1980s and the war in the former Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. More than 50 percent of the refugees who came to the U.S. since that time are Eastern Europeans (U.S. Department of Justice, 1999). While many challenges can be clustered under crosscultural issues, considering the diversity of these refugees in the U.S., researchers need to address specific difficulties with surveying refugees and solutions for these difficulties. Further, communitybased research on refugees requires special attention to ethical issues, which are beyond a scope of the federal regulations on research ethics. Pernice (1994) argued some methodological difficulties of studying mental health issues of refugees, challenging the universal applicability of conventional research methods used by psychologists. Her research was primarily with Indochinese refugees and Pacific Island immigrants to New Zealand. In this paper, we specify several difficulties with surveying refugees based upon our own research on refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina in St. Louis, Missouri. Difficulties with Surveying Refugees and Solutions There are five major difficulties with surveying refugees. Conceptualization of the research topic: Researchers conduct an extensive literature review on a relevant research topic for the purpose of conceptualization and subsequent hypothesis development. There are cases in which very few references relevant to the research topic or the target population exist. This was the case of the study with Bosnian refugees. Most of the research on Bosnian refugees is related to political and mental health issues. Although there existed a large number of studies on Cuban refugees and Vietnamese refugees who came to the U.S. in the 1960\\\\u2019s and 1970\\\\u2019s respectively, a question arose whether or not some of these findings are applicable to Bosnian refugees who entered the U.S. in the 1990\\\\u2019s. Bosnians\\\\u2019 religious background as Muslims and racial background as Caucasians also made them very distinct in comparison with Cubans and Vietnamese who were racial minorities. Due to the lack of extensive literature available for conceptualization and the ethnic characteristics different from previous refugees, the authors used a \\\\u2018sequential exploratory method\\\\u2019 with a grounded theory method. We specified several concepts which are assumed to explain Bosnians\\\\u2019 resettlement processes, based upon qualitative data which were obtained from face-toface interview with Bosnian refugees, service providers at refugee resettlement agencies, and state and federal officials. Two major concepts emerged from data analysis: Comfort (finding an emotional niche) and Competence (finding a material niche). Bosnians in St. Louis are very resilient, and demonstrate a \\\\u201csense of coherence,\\\\u201d a term coined by Aaron Antonovsky (1979), who studied Holocaust survivors in the U.S. A sense of coherence is different from coping skills in that negative experiences during one\\\\u2019s life course lead to a stronger will to survive. In other words, \\\\u201cwhat does not kill me makes me stronger.\\\\u201d Refugees undergo the process of redefinition of their identity and community development as most immigrants do, but their redefinition process differs from that of immigrants because of the refugees\\\\u2019 forced migration to a host country (Lam and Lanphier 2002; Warner 1993). Sense of Coherence is one of the contributing factors to refugees\\\\u2019 successful integration into a host country, community development, and identity reconstruction, impacting their overall satisfaction with being in America even though it was not their choice. However, this emotional niche is also impacted by the refugees\\\\u2019 material satisfaction, especially in the area of securing jobs and consequent occupational status. It was inevitable for refugees who held prestigious jobs in Bosnia to experience occupational demotion because of a lack of English competency and licensing problems. Furthermore, Locus of Control, Spiritual Healing, Social Support, and Experience of Discrimination are also important intervening factors which have impact on Comfort that refugees experience during the process of adaptation to American society. While Locus of Control serves as a buffer between the traumatic experiences in the war and displacement and the life satisfaction in a host country, Spiritual Healing and Social Support contribute to reducing sources of stress, having a positive impact on Comfort.\", \"year\": 2006}, {\"paperId\": \"4e2bf10e21d8444c8bc7c302d092da4c50226cdb\", \"title\": \"Oral history off the record : toward an ethnography of practice\", \"abstract\": \"Foreword Steven High Introduction: Toward an Ethnography of Practice Anna Sheftel and Stacey Zembrzycki PART I: REFLECTIONS ON A LIFETIME OF LISTENING Section Introduction: Henry Greenspan 1.

Moreover, research has demonstrated that engaging in planful problem-solving activities is associated with reduced distress. Accordingly, we aimed to examine the link between engaging in activities during COVID-19 and psychological distress among Holocaust survivors with varying levels of post-traumatic symptoms (PTS) and comparisons (not directly exposed to the Holocaust). Design: A cross-sectional design composed of Holocaust survivors and a comparison group. Setting: Participants were interviewed face-to-face, over the telephone, or filled the scales online at their leisure. Participants: Data were collected from 131 older Jewish Israelis (age range 76\\\\u201394, M = 82.73, SD = 4.09), who were divided into three groups (comparisons; low-PTS survivors; high-PTS survivors). Measurements: Participants completed scales assessing PTS, activity engagement, and psychological distress and provided additional sociodemographic, medical, and COVID-19-related information. Results: When activity engagement was low, high-PTS survivors reported extremely high levels of psychological distress relative to low-PTS survivors and comparisons. However, when activity engagement was high, these group differences were considerably reduced, as the psychological distress of high-PTS survivors was significantly lower. Conclusions: The study highlights the importance of daily planning and activity engagement for Holocaust survivors with high PTS levels in reducing psychological distress.

David P. Boder\\'s 1946 Interviews of Holocaust Survivors\", \"abstract\": \"In the summer of 1946, psychology professor David P. Boder (1886-1961) of the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) visited various displaced persons\\' camps in Western Europe to record the testimonies of Jews who had survived the Holocaust. For this purpose he brought along a wire recorder, a relatively-new invention of IIT\\'s Armour Research Foundation. Over the course of the summer, Boder fulfilled his mission, interviewing over 120 survivors and nearly exhausting his supply of wire spools. Back in the U.S., Boder spent most of his remaining fifteen years translating and transcribing these interviews, for as wide a dissemination as he could manage given the resources and technologies available in that era. Those are the simple facts--or, rather, the simplest facts one can posit about a story that began in complexity and which will continue to challenge humanity in its eternal quest to capture and communicate truth through the varied disciples of documentation and history. Certainly, the historical factuality of the Holocaust is accepted by the vast majority of those today who possess enough intellect, information, open-mindedness, and empathy. Unfortunately, there are also those who dispute the basic facts of this calamity--and, given that fact, the process of education cannot rest. In the late 1990s, IIT\\'s Galvin Library created the first version of its \\\\\"Voices of the Holocaust\\\\\" web site, which provided Boder\\'s English translations as well as audio clips from the minority of interviews that had been conducted in English. Such an initial effort, though limited, was a worthy endeavor. Participating staff members were called upon to re-type Boder\\'s 1950s transcripts for web use and many were profoundly moved by what they read. Then, in December 2005, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad labeled the Holocaust a \\\\\"myth.\\\\\" IIT Dean of Libraries Christopher Stewart then committed personnel and financial resources so that the remaining audio files could be posted to the site, along with transcriptions and translations that Boder had not been able to complete during his life. The vastly-improved and augmented website went live at the end of 2009. Given my \\\\\"two hats\\\\\" (an archival career coupled with a PhD. in modern European history) I was privileged to be a member of the core team that laid the groundwork for the new website in 2007-2009. However, my exceptionally-gifted colleague, Eben English, Galvin Library\\'s then-Digital Services Librarian, logged many more hours on the project than I while supervising a battery of students and translators both on-site and remotely (some as far removed as Germany). [FIGURE 1 OMITTED] In the process of preparing the new website, I of course learned more about the Holocaust and Boder\\'s career--and also about the changing usages of audio-recorded interviews since the 1940s. Those evolving usages have been determined by 1) changing goals and methodologies both in the media and in the social sciences; and, 2) by the changing technologies that have been available to those disciplines. In the remainder of this essay I will cover key elements of the larger narrative (the Holocaust and Boder\\'s role in documenting it) but will also offer some thoughts and observations on the evolution of what is now commonly known as audio-recorded \\\\\"oral history.\\\\\" The Man Who Sat Behind the Microphone It is important to know something about the man who sat behind the microphone: David P. Boder. Born in Lithuania in 1886 (when still a part of the Russian Empire), Boder was born Aron Mendel Michelsen in Libau (now Liepaja, Latvia), where his father worked in the Russian civil service. Right from birth, Boder straddled different worlds. Being Jewish in a deeply anti-Semitic empire presented the greatest potential challenge. But other cultural forces swirled around him as well.

In the analysis that follows, I focus on Irene Oore\\\\u2019s 2019 memoir, The Listener: In the Shadow of the Holocaust, because, as the title suggests, Oore thematizes the question of listening, asking what it means to listen to a survivor parent. My analysis considers domestic listening in relation to Holocaust testimony as well as to listening as emotion work. Oore\\\\u2019s text posits life writing as the most desirable outcome of domestic listening, for it can be an act of care which elicits the retelling of witness accounts. In publishing her mother\\\\u2019s stories, as well as her own experiences of listening to them, Oore\\'s postmemory writing functions as deferred and mediated testimony which her mother never publicly gave.\", \"year\": 2021}, {\"paperId\": \"509bd744789162611da0e29a61673a41060333f4\", \"title\": \"Jewish Resistance During the Holocaust: Moral Uses of Violence and Will (review)\", \"abstract\": \"Jewish Resistance During the Holocaust: Moral Uses of Violence and Will, by James M. Glass. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004. 206 pp. $40.00. Usually, when one is contacted about reviewing a new book, it is a fairly straight-forward process: one decides if the topic falls within one\\'s competence, and then one decides whether or not to accept the editor\\'s invitation to write the review. Having written on prisoners of war during the Second World War, and having taught lectures and seminars on Hitler, Stalin, the Second World War, and the Holocaust, the reviewer felt no compunction about agreeing to examine James M. Glass\\'s Jewish Resistance During the Holocaust: Moral Uses of Violence and Will. And yet, it was far from an easy process to evaluate Professor Glass\\'s work. Part of the problem comes from the fact that this book cannot easily be categorized as falling within a single discipline: it raises questions and deals with topics of politics, history, psychology, sociology, philosophy, and theology. The reviewer, shamefully, has a difficult enough time speaking to colleagues within his department, let alone across the departmental divides within a campus. Reviewing this book may go some way toward rectifying this tendency. James M. Glass is Professor of Politics at the University of Maryland, College Park. He has, as the publisher informs the reader, a distinguished career as both a scholar (in terms of publications) and teacher, and has much experience in navigating between emotional, psychological, and political topics-in the last decade, with reference to the Holocaust. The book originated as a series of lectures and conference papers, which were subsequently reworked. It is based primarily upon previously published secondary literature, but is supplemented with vivid personal testimony from survivors, obtained through interviews conducted by the author, as well as surviving diaries and memoirs. Glass successfully avoids the pitfalls that often come from cobbling together sections prepared originally for other purposes: the work is thematically coherent and compelling. Structurally, his book is divided into the following chapters (with the subheadings, where they exist, in parentheses): Introduction: Memory, Resistance and Reclaiming the Self; 1) The Moral Justification for Killing (The ghetto: demoralization and breakdown); 2) Collective Trauma: The Disintegration of Ethics (Devastation to body and mind: ghetto isolation, Underground action: self and its restoration, Ghetto authority and underground action, The Jewish community and depletion of will); 3) The Moral Position of Violence: Bielski Survivors (The Bielski survivors: the past in the present); 4) The Moral Goodness of Violence: Necessity in the Forests (Political organization and political action, Violence and the recovery of self, Escape to the forests, Politics in the forest: community transforming self); 5) Spiritual Resistance: Understanding its Meaning (Recording and witnessing: what is being seen, Spirit and survival: the protections of the inner self, Arguing with God: a dialogue regarding faith, Dissociative psychological process: not seeing the pain); 6) Condemned Spirit and the Moral Arguments of Faith (Physical assault and disorientation, God\\'s presence in the self, Domination: Patterns of injustice, Soul-death and faith); 7) The Silence of Faith Facing the Emptied-out Self; 8) Law and Spirit in Terrible Times (Mysticism and faith: action as belief, Spiritual refuge or psychological disintegration: who can ever know?). It is followed by extensive footnotes (offering both citations and elaborations), a thorough bibliography, and an effective index. Perusing the sub-headings gives an indication of the path the author takes, and the reader will likely be drawn to some sections more than others, based on his previous knowledge of the Holocaust and his personal interests. All sections, from the academic point of view, are soundly presented and backed by appropriate evidence. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2006}, {\"paperId\": \"50bbc62c48c036a4ca2a0fbee54518ec0027cf55\", \"title\": \"Five Lives of a Holocaust Survivor: On Shifting Identities, the Search for Belonging, and Building Meaning\", \"abstract\": \"This article belongs to the special cluster, \\\\u201cBiographies of Belonging in the Holocaust\\\\u201d, guest-edited by Natalia Aleksiun and Hana Kub\\\\u00e1tov\\\\u00e1.

These narratives, whether developed in prisons, camps, or ghettos, or in the aftermath of National Socialism, are key to understanding the victims\\' perspectives. Many works disclose intimate aspects of daily life that only victims saw and experienced.

Thus, while they were allowed for a time to coexist with the rest of German society, they were granted only the most marginal or menial jobs, restricted from marrying Aryans or even leading normal social lives, and sent eventually to forced-labour and concentration camps. More than 70,000 Germans were subjected to these restrictions and indignities, created and fostered by Hitler\\'s morally bankrupt race laws, yet few personal accounts of their experiences exist. In this title, James Tent recounts how these men and women from all over Germany and from all walks of life struggled to survive in an increasingly hostile society, even as their Jewish relatives were disappearing into the East. He draws on extensive interviews with 20 survivors, many of whom were teenagers when Hitler came to power, to show how \\\\\"half Jews\\\\\" coped with conditions on a day-to-day basis and how the legacy of the hatred they suffered has forever lingered in their minds. Tent provides stories of life beneath the boot-heel of Nazi rule: a woman deemed unsuitable for a career in nursing because the shape of her earlobes and breasts indicated she was not \\\\\"racially suited\\\\\", a man arrested for \\\\\"race defilement\\\\\" because he lived with an Aryan woman, and many others. He shows how Nazi discrimination and persecution affected their lives and how such treatment intensified through the later years of the war. Tent\\'s witnesses share experiences in school and problems in the workplace, where the best survival strategy was to find an unobtrusive niche in a nondescript job. They tell of obstacles to personal relationships and they soberly remind us that by 1944 they too were rounded up for forced labour, certain to be the next victims of Nazi genocide. This text demonstrates the lengths to which the Nazis were willing to go in order to eradicate Judaism - a fanaticism that increased over time and even in the face of impending military defeat. The \\\\\"Halbjuden\\\\\" mostly survived the Holocaust, yet they paid for their re-assimilation into German society by remaining silent in the face of haunting memories. This book breaks that silence and is a testament to human endurance under the most trying circumstances.\", \"year\": 2003}, {\"paperId\": \"53d61b0a228cfbde2167bf91719f4b8cc2423f70\", \"title\": \"The Myth of Hitler\\'s Pope (review)\", \"abstract\": \"The Myth of Hitler\\'s Pope. By Rabbi David G. Dalin. (Washington, D.C.: Regnery Publishing Co. 2005. Pp. ix, 209. $27.95.) This book had its genesis in an article by Rabbi Dalin in the Weekly Standard of February 26, 2001, entitled \\\\\"Pius XII and the Jews.\\\\\" There Dalin showed that as Nuncio in Germany in the 1920\\'s, as Papal Secretary of State from 1930, and as Pope from 1939, Eugenio Pacelli was a consistent and outspoken opponent of the Nazis.\\\\\"People at the time,\\\\\" Dalin wrote,\\\\\"Nazis and Jews alike, understood the pope to be the world\\'s most prominent opponent of the Nazi ideology.\\\\\" Hitler\\'s propaganda machine branded him \\\\\"the Jew-loving cardinal.\\\\\" During World War II Pius XII inspired and directed rescue efforts which saved hundreds of thousands of Jews from destruction. For this he received many expressions of thanks from the survivors, both during the war and thereafter. With few exceptions, Dalin charged, those who today criticize Pius XII for silence and inaction in the face of the Holocaust are angry or lapsed Catholics seeking to discredit papal authority. Their polemic would have shocked Jews of an earlier generation. By overlooking contemporary Jewish tributes to the pontiff, his present-day critics are hijacking the Holocaust in the interest of an innerCatholic debate. Jews, whatever their view of the Catholic Church, have a duty to condemn those who disparage the testimony of Holocaust survivors, especially when it transfers to others the condemnation that belongs properly to Hitler and the Nazis. Pius XII deserves not condemnation, Dalin concluded, but inclusion in Yad Vashem\\'s still lengthening list of \\\\\"righteous gentiles.\\\\\" The Myth of Hitler\\'s Pope expands this argument with additional supporting evidence. Like the works of the pope\\'s critics, it is not really history but advocacy. This is a lawyer\\'s brief for the defense, and it is brilliantly argued. For the pope\\'s critics it is devastating. Dalin bolsters his case by a chapter on \\\\\"Hitler\\'s Mufti,\\\\\" an Arab cleric who publicly supported Hitler\\'s program of Jewish extermination, both during the war in Berlin and thereafter in the Middle East. Hajj Amin al-Husseini, a virulent and active anti-Semite born in Jerusalem in 1893, was appointed Grand Mufti of Jerusalem by the British in 1922. The instigator of numerous terrorist attacks on Jews before and after the creation of the state of Israel, Husseini died in exile in 1974. Among his disciples were the Egyptian dictator Gamal Abdul Nasser and Yasser Arafat, who in an interview as late as August, 2002, called Husseini \\\\\"our hero.\\\\\" Dalin asks why Pius XII\\'s critics are so silent about the virulent hatred of Jews in the Arab world today. \\\\\"It is particularly irresponsible and outrageous,\\\\\" Dalin writes, for these critics \\\\\"to blame the Catholic Church for anti-Semitism, to falsify the Church\\'s efforts to save Jews during the Holocaust, and to ignore the fact that popes since the twelfth century have rejected the blood libel [that Jews use the blood of Christian children for ritual purposes]. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2005}, {\"paperId\": \"53df4b9f76f3d2b1c067b1402c046bb19af996ec\", \"title\": \"Interpretation of the Unimaginable: The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, Washington, D.C., and \\\\u201cDark Tourism\\\\u201d\", \"abstract\": \"The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., has received visitation levels in excess of 2 million per annum since its opening in April 1993.

In fact, she says she has inherited my unconscious melancholy. I don\\'t think I am a morbid person. I feel content with my life \\\\u2014 with my marriage of 40 years, my three wonderful children, my home in a part of the world where others save their pennies to visit for two weeks out of the year. Even the loss of my work as a result of cancer has brought some positive things. Yet I know what my daughter means. I do carry about some deep, mysterious sadness and have done so all my life. \\\\n \\\\nI was not always aware of it. Had my daughter made her comments 15 years ago, I would have disagreed with her. Around that time we were visiting some Jewish friends. They were upset with me for not teaching my children more about our Jewish heritage. I told them that my own childhood was lacking in Jewish religious education and that I wanted my children to make their own decisions about spiritual values. If they were interested in Judaism they could explore it themselves. Our hosts became quite angry, and at one point the husband raised his voice and called me a \\\\u201cHolocaust survivor.\\\\u201d That ended the discussion. I thought his comment was bizarre, but I always remembered it just the same. \\\\n \\\\nA few years later, I participated in a workshop sponsored by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross. The seminar dealt with issues of death and dying as well as other kinds of loss, such as divorce and abuse. For reasons I do not recall, I started to explore my feelings around being a Jew, an exercise that culminated with me screaming \\\\u201cI am a Jew\\\\u201d at the top of my lungs for several minutes. I never hid the fact of my Jewishness, but I didn\\'t advertise it either. \\\\n \\\\nMy last name is originally German and I seemed to pass as a Gentile. When I entered medical school I received invitations from medical fraternities to join their ranks. During \\\\u201crush week\\\\u201d I quickly noticed that none of the other applicants were Jewish. (As a Jew you learn to recognize other \\\\u201clandsmen.\\\\u201d) I was asked to join one of the fraternities, but when I asked them if they had any restrictive policies about Jewish members, the embarrassed reply was Yes. It then became apparent that only non-Jews were invited to rush week, but because no one knew me, and my last name gave no clue, I was inadvertently asked to participate. The good news is that a second fraternity chose to change their charter and welcomed me as their first Jewish brother. \\\\n \\\\nMy only formal Jewish education was at an ultra-Reform temple in Chicago. We jokingly called it St. Sinai on the Lake. I attended Sunday school, and at age 13 I was confirmed, rather than bar mitzvahed as my older brothers had been. I never learned Hebrew or travelled to Israel. My future attendance at temple was on ceremonial occasions only. \\\\n \\\\nI have a not-so-latent obsession with the Holocaust and the Second World War. My family laughs when I go out to rent a video; they want to know what Holocaust film I will return with. I read books, fiction and non-fiction, on Holocaust themes. I especially enjoy those that describe personal journeys involving dangerous escapes or heroic deeds. Sometimes I just want to read about life in the shtetl or ghetto. And, to be honest, the acts of horror also captivate my attention. But the Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC, is the closest I\\'ve been to the physical reality of the war. \\\\n \\\\nWhy this morbid fascination and curiosity? Where does my sadness originate? My immediate family escaped the Holocaust in Germany, first by moving to Europe, and ultimately by emigrating to Chicago in 1938. I was born two years later \\\\u2014 an \\\\u201caccident.\\\\u201d After I was born my mother, then in her 40s, was hospitalized briefly for depression. Was it an accident that I was conceived around the time my paternal grandmother was murdered in Theriesenstadt? Was I unconsciously brought into this world to replace lost souls? \\\\n \\\\nMy parents never discussed their pain at leaving Europe. My father, a physician, left an important university appointment in 1933, the day after Hitler became Reich chancellor. How did it feel to say goodbye to family for the last time? How did it feel to survive when so many perished? My father\\'s sister died in the Warsaw Ghetto. I was told some facts. I was shown some photos in an album. Feelings and emotions were never expressed. We spoke German at home. \\\\n \\\\nI have a video of my aunt talking to an interviewer about her life before leaving Germany. She described her work in the underground, and Kristallnacht, and the death of those close to her. But she turns off her emotional reactions as soon as they begin to surface and, instead, focuses on an intellectual discussion of events. \\\\n \\\\nWhen I was 11 years old my parents took me to Europe for a summer holiday. It seems remarkable to me now that we went to Germany and Austria as tourists in 1951, only six years after the war. The railway stations were still mostly rubble from the Allied bombs. Later I learned that my father went to Frankfurt to claim financial compensation from the German government. I even received a few hundred dollars every month I was in university, as part of the reparation agreement. \\\\n \\\\nLater I went on to specialize in psychiatry. Another accident? As part of my training I spent a lot of time examining my life and my family interactions. I saw in myself a tendency to deny my emotions and to intellectualize. I worked hard to reverse this trend. This period coincided with the hippie era, and so drugs also assisted me in my quest for emotional and spiritual answers. I learned a lot, but until my daughter mentioned it, I never really recognized my sadness. \\\\n \\\\nNow I understand this sadness as inherited, almost archetypal. It has roots in Judaism and branches in my immediate family of origin. Some of the flowers are in my family, and the seeds are dispersing to grow in the future. The difference now is awareness. Sadness is not the problem. Denial is. \\\\n \\\\nMy daughter, a filmmaker, has plans to make a documentary exploring our relationship and our mutual experience of sadness. The idea occurred to her when I talked about visiting Germany and seeing the birthplace of my parents. I plan to go back to Germany, to visit a concentration camp, and to see the old house belonging to our family, which has recently been relocated to a museum, to be restored as an example of German\\\\u2013Jewish heritage. My daughter wants to travel with me and, perhaps, to witness the healing of some wounds. The thought of this common adventure fills me with happiness.

From the perspective of disenfranchised grief, defined as grief that is not socially recognized or supported, the article links Monika\\'s testimony with existing research from in-depth interviews with other descendants of Nazis to suggest that, as a group, they lacked permission to grieve their deceased parents, acknowledgment of their grief, and opportunities to mourn.

In later life, traumatic memories do not only occur spontaneously and unexpectedly; moreover, they are an essential part of the people\\'s frame of reference for questions about personal identity, perceptions of social relationships, society and societal development, and coping with specific themes. Following a pilot study on subjective reconstruction of the life course in (former) Jewish emigrants and extermination camp survivors, different phases of post-holocaust development are distinguished. Self-ratings for intensity of traumatic reminiscence for these phases of personal development support the hypothesis that traumatic reminiscence increased in old age. People highly differ in coping with stressful reminiscence. Some study participants react with depression, anxiety, feelings of survivor guilt, and withdrawal from social relationships. Others, however, are highly engaged in social relationships, especially with the following generations. They want to give a contribution to the educational work of their society and to prevent discrimination, racism, and xenophobia.\", \"year\": 1998}, {\"paperId\": \"58993846428bf12dd4d65f9e0d2d340fa473d940\", \"title\": \"Helen Lang interview\", \"abstract\": \"An interview with Helen Lang, a Holocaust survivor, conducted by Dr. Sidney Bolkosky, Professor of History at the University of Michigan--Dearborn. Helen Lang was born in Munkacs, Czechoslovakia. Following the Hungarian annexation of the area, Helen went to work in Budapest to help support her family. While visiting her family during Pesach in 1944, the Germans came into the city and shipped Helen and her family to Auschwitz-Birkenau. After a month in Birkenau, Helen and her sister were transferred to Stutthof, where Helen was made a Blockaltester. Helen and her sister were then shipped to Praust, a brand new camp, where she was a maid for the SS guards, and secured her sister as a Blockaltester as well. When the Russians neared Praust the camp was evacuated and Helen, her sister, and a friend escaped the march,posing as Hungarian Gentiles. They met a group of SS doctors who took them to Denmark to stay for the duration of the war. After the war, Helen stayed in the Lubeck DP camp in Germany and moved to Prague to reunite with her family.\", \"year\": 1982}, {\"paperId\": \"58f8ce55107c58d2bcdf1b3497f5dc086499f434\", \"title\": \"Holocaust survivors: Coping with post-traumatic memories in childhood and 40 years later\", \"abstract\": \"This essay deals with coping processes of childhood trauma of survivors who were children during World War II over the lifecycle in a nonclinical group. The main issues refer to: (1) responses to war memories immediately after the war and 40 years later; (2) dealing with memories and feelings at present; (3) victims\\' feelings and attitudes toward the persecutor; (4) attitudes of survivors\\' children to the war experience of their parents; and (5) coping styles immediately and 40 years after the war, including the survivors\\' responses at present. Using a semistructural interview and a qualitative content analysis of interviews, it is suggested that for most persons the reactivation of memories and the need to document their experiences enhances, in a limited scope, the recognition of their loss and brings some relief; it also discloses new ways for these adults to comprehend their traumatic past.\", \"year\": 1990}, {\"paperId\": \"592c6e6694afaad2f6e8a401c29aa2847ede0278\", \"title\": \"An Interview with Henry \\\\u2018Hank\\\\u2019 Greenspan\", \"abstract\": \"ABSTRACT Kobi Kabalek interviews Henry (Hank) Greenspan about his sustained collaborations with Holocaust survivors, his questioning of conventional concepts in the field such as \\\\u2018testimony\\\\u2019 and \\\\u2018trauma,\\\\u2019 his convictions and strategies as a teacher, and his drive to embody some of what he has learned in playwriting and dramatic performance.

In political terms it means an explosion. The Palestinian uprising erupted in the Gaza strip in December 1987 after 20 years of Israeli military occupation. It quickly spread to the West Bank and Jerusalem. What the world saw of the intifada were the photographs of Israeli soldiers breaking Palstinians\\' bones, Palestinians hurling Molotov cocktails at Jewish housewives or rocks at soldiers. The author writes about the real life behind those photographs. She travelled throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip interviewing both Jews and Palestinians in an attempt to document their lives. She watched the intifada flourish and then wane, Middle East peace talks come and go, and more frightening, the lengths to which people of both sides are driven when they become desperate. Weaving together accounts of weeks spent with armed militant factions of the PLO, the memories of a Holocaust survivor who defended the Palestinians in military courts for 25 years, the faded dreams of the Israeli Left and the emotional impact of occupation on the children, the author builds a complex picture of \\\\\"the new Sparta of the Middle East\\\\\".

The authors pose different research questions, use distinct methodologies to collect empirical evidence, write about specific demographic groups (Zeltser studies the Red Army personnel, for example), and offer commentary on a range of issues. Anna Shternshis\\'s essay, because of its methodology, is among the last of its kind. Soon there will be no more Holocaust survivors for scholars to interview. The author managed to speak with some 200 Jews who were Soviet citizens before 1939 and were evacuated from their place of residence in the western USSR into the Soviet interior. Technically, since they never came into contact with the Nazis, they should not be considered Holocaust survivors, but the matter has not been sorted out in the historical literature. Polish Jews deported into the Soviet interior in 1939-41--victims of Soviet repression to which they inadvertently owed their lives, and numerically the largest group of Polish Jews to survive the war--are \\\\\"automatically\\\\\" included among Holocaust survivors. They were allowed to return to their country after liberation and then, already after the war, massively fled from life-threatening Polish antisemitism to displaced persons (DP) camps in the American occupation zone in Germany. Only in 2007 did Attina Grossman begin to puzzle over why their status was not problematized in the literature. (1) Their recollections--including what they learned during the stopover in Poland about their families\\' deaths under Nazi occupation--are abundant in the archives of Holocaust testimonies, both in the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw and in Yad Vashem. In Shternshis\\'s article a single pre-Holocaust finding ominously stands out. When queried about what motivated their evacuation decision before the Nazis\\' arrival her respondents quoted fear of neighbors--of pogroms, in other words--as the most important factor that induced them to flee. Memory of the German occupation from the time of World War I, which lingered among local residents, was benign. And since Soviet propaganda muted criticism of anything untoward that the Third Reich did after the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact, there was no information about anti-Jewish Nazi policies in occupied Poland. People did, however, remember well the wave of pogroms that swept the area in the aftermath of the October Revolution and during the Civil War. With the prospect of collapse of the Soviet state authority as the front was rapidly approaching, many Jews fled, mindful of their neighbors\\' aggression a generation earlier. The study by Vladimir Solonari is grounded in the most promising sources of all those drawn upon in these essays. The historiographical breakthrough in Holocaust studies that we have observed in Poland in the last decade came through the systematic exploration of court files produced, for the most part, in the late 1940s when people were brought to justice for alleged wartime collaboration with the Germans. Solonari\\'s essay demonstrates that similar materials--postwar trials and investigations--provide rich details about the mechanism of, and personnel involved in, killings of Jews in southern Ukraine. His study is limited to the area occupied by the Romanians, but there is no reason, it seems to me, why a similar quality of evidence could not be culled from the Soviet-era secret police archives about other regions of Ukraine and Belorussia. Anika Walke\\'s article about Jewish youth in the Minsk ghetto makes in passing an interesting point that Soviet Jews were the most impoverished (542-43). They had no personal property to speak of, which in itself adversely affected their chances of survival in hiding compared to Jews from \\\\\"capitalist\\\\\" Eastern Europe. Among young Jewish boys raised in the Soviet Union, however, only \\\\\"some of them were circumcised\\\\\" (551), which gave them as a cohort more survival chances outside the ghetto. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2014}, {\"paperId\": \"5b2c756cd3e75f4e3792c7f29e2e081111830c4e\", \"title\": \"Revisionen\", \"abstract\": \"Abstract Referring to the video testimony of Holocaust survivor Mrs. K. and interviewer and psychoanalyst Kurt Gr\\\\u00fcnberg, I propose to analyse the body movement behavior in interaction in this interview as the \\\\u201cGestalt\\\\u201d of memory units.

The study sample was composed of 356 Amharic-speaking Ethiopians from Ethiopia and Israel, aged 18\\\\u201455, divided into three groups: i) general population; ii) people in non-psychiatric treatment; iii) people in psychiatric treatment. They were interviewed with the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ), modified to include 10 culturally specific items, and the Brief Psychiatric Research Scale (BPRS) as a criterion of psychopathology. Physicians also completed an encounter form about the presence of mental health symptoms in participants. To make the questions more culturespecific, the translation of 12 items on the SRQ was changed. The content, construct, and criterion validity of each question were also examined, leading to the deletion of five items. The validity of the revised instrument (SRQ-F) was superior to that of the original instrument (SRQ). This study demonstrates the need for psychiatric screening instruments to be adapted to different cultures by incorporating meaningful translations and adding culturally specific items.\", \"year\": 2009}, {\"paperId\": \"5deca084024eaa3ae9de1cf645f1091a893c9fe7\", \"title\": \"Fred Zinnemann\\'s Search (1945-48): Reconstructing the voices of Europe\\'s children\", \"abstract\": \"In the years immediately following World War II, American filmmakers contemplating foreign locations encountered massive logistical problems and ideological resistance from studio bosses.

Her study deals with the results of group encounters between children of Holocaust survivors and children of Nazi perpetrators she supervised over a ten-year period. The volume carries a slightly deceptive title, as the word justice is used in the context of post-Holocaust dialogue between these second generation groups. In this respect, justice means a process for dialogue and coming to terms with the past, which has resulted in many misconceptions by each side about the other, rather than issues connected with financial restitution. The author\\'s interest in the subject came from her own background as a child of Holocaust survivors, plus some of the disquieting conclusions drawn by Hannah Arendt from the trial of Adolf Eichmann about \\\\\"the banality of evil\\\\\" and the accusations of Jewish complicity through the Jewish councils (Judenrate). Weissmark also uses Stanley Milgram\\'s well-known electrical shock experiment that focused on obedience to authority as a source for understanding the relationship between German antisemitism and the issue of how obedience played a role in the extermination of the Jews. Weissmark confesses that conclusions by both Arendt and Milgram established taboos about investigating attitudes among the second generations: Jewish actions that helped the Nazis might reduce the uniqueness of the Holocaust and implicate Jews in their own destruction, while Milgram\\'s experiment might suggest that following orders rather than hatred was the dominant motive for German actions. All of this might be a rehashing of well-known historical issues if the author had not asked the question of how the above issues were passed to subsequent generations on both sides. In this book, the bulk of the interesting and new material comes directly from clinical sessions between the two second-generation groups that met together. It is in this context that the issue of justice becomes intergenerational. The key answer which the author as psychologist seems to search for is how both children of survivors and children of Nazis have perceived both injustice and justice in their parents\\' experiences. The study ultimately was based on interviewing eleven children of Holocaust survivors and eleven children of Nazi perpetrators. The survey and interview project seems to have revealed some interesting conclusions. First was \\\\\"ethnic identification,\\\\\" meaning that both sides shared an identity that was rooted in the war experiences of the parents. Secondly, \\\\\"double victimization\\\\\" was identified as children of each victim group repeated the experiences of their parents as essential elements in their lives. The third issue was \\\\\"feelings of indignation\\\\\" that each side felt relating to the nature of the crime and justice or the nature of the guilt inflicted on the German side in the aftermath of the war. Weissmark indicates that institutionalization of resentment in the post-war era through reparations seems to have satisfied neither side. Survivors have felt short-changed and disturbed because of the massive alterations and trauma in their lives, while Germans had to deal with issues of collective guilt. The author notes that \\\\\"[t]he program failed to remedy feelings of hatred and resentment; in fact, it perpetuated such feelings\\\\\" (p. 69). It is the conclusion about the failure of immediate post-war justice programs that led the author to conclude that redressing the injustices can only be solved through dialogue. The dialogue she refers to involves the next generation, to whom the guilt and sense of indignity was transferred. So, process here is perhaps as important as results, in that discussion in Weissmark\\'s group led to each side facing the other, often for the first time, in an open setting. The result was complex, but one conclusion was that both groups felt themselves as victims of the past and that attitudes handed down from parents about this past were impediments to independent thinking about the subject. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2005}, {\"paperId\": \"5f679b9a0678fa2b982caea0d76e8c83bfd05e2a\", \"title\": \"THE VICTIM AS HELPER-PROSOCIAL BEHAVIOR DURING THE HOLOCAUST*\", \"abstract\": \"The focus of this paper is on the incidence and nature of help received and provided by victims during the Holocaust.

Each story focuses on: a) the oral history and ethnographic significance of sharing particularities of each survivor\\\\u2019s vi experience through our dialogues together; b) broader insights and explorations of the central themes (compassion, identification, and affinity) that emerged from our interviews and relationships. The final chapter concludes by reflecting on and synthesizing the values and limitations of this project. As a whole, this dissertation cultivates and exemplifies: a) a unique understanding of humane and humanistic approaches to ethnographic methods in the fields of communication and oral history; b) compassion, identification, and affinity as important lenses and motives to consider in research with individuals (in particular individual survivors of mass atrocities); c) the historical value and need to continue developing diverse approaches to scholarship that centralize personal stories, dialogue, peace, wisdom, and work that represents marginalized experiences and experiences of marginalization in a violent, oppressive world. This dissertation is offered as a token of remembrance of the Holocaust and to those who shared their stories with me.\", \"year\": 2013}, {\"paperId\": \"625abc6a0880bd1ba2ed2281370f4ec3955b37c6\", \"title\": \"\\\\u2018Remembering for Us\\\\u2019: The Transgenerational Transmission of Holocaust Memory and Commemoration\", \"abstract\": \"Commemoration has moved from the periphery to the centre of Australian Jewish consciousness, a trend that is also discernable amongst Jewish communities.

Such firepower has profound and troubling implications for insects namely, has escalation in the arms race produced enough atomic weaponry that if a nuclear war were to break out, a cockroach maybe couldn\\\\u2019t survive? It\\\\u2019s one of those entomological truisms, a fact that everyone who knows nothing else about insects can recite, that \\\\u201cIf there\\\\u2019s a nuclear war, cockroaches will be the only survivors.\\\\u201d Cultural references to the radiationresistance and durability of cockroaches abound. According to an interview with band member Coby Dick, the metal/punk group Papa Roach picked the name because \\\\u201ca cockroach can survive anything: earthquake, nuclear holocaust. They come in small numbers, and then they infest. We want to infest the world\\\\u201d (S. Quelland 1999, http:// www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/ 10.07.99/paparoach-9940.html). When officials in New Zealand wanted to alert the public about Y2K preparedness, they chose as their symbol a cockroach because its ability to survive any kind of disaster, including a nuclear one, is so well known (http:// www.jsonline.com/news/intl/ap/jul99/apnew-zealand-mil072299.asp). There\\\\u2019s even a website advertising a \\\\u201cgiant deluxe cockroach,\\\\u201d a five-inch rubber roach, \\\\u201cwhich like most cockroaches could probably survive a nuclear war\\\\u201d (http://www.insectarium.com/ NewCatalog/toys/09525.htm). So, people can take comfort in the thought that the fortunate few human survivors of a nuclear Armageddon can play post-Apocalyptic practical jokes on one another. It\\\\u2019s not easy to figure out where this idea of cockroach radiation resilience originated. It doesn\\\\u2019t seem to have been the result of an empirical test. Atomic bomb blasts have been (mercifully) few and far between and, after an exhaustive search, I couldn\\\\u2019t find any obvious references to postblast investigators noting the presence of unperturbed roaches at ground zero. There are, though, dozens of references on the Internet and elsewhere to the solitary gingko tree that apparently remained standing after the bomb blast in Hiroshima; vendors of herbal medicines unfailingly mention that fact when touting the virtues of gingko in maintaining mental acuity, preventing asthma attacks, speeding poststroke recovery, and increasing blood flow to the penis (e.g., http://www. nutraceutical.com/educate/pdf/gingko.pdf). So, most likely, the idea that cockroaches would be the sole survivors of a nuclear holocaust must have come from laboratory studies on radiation resistance. But what laboratory data exist aren\\\\u2019t exactly consistent with cockroach supremacy. Among other things, cockroaches are relative newcomers to the ranks of the radiation-resistant. Probably the first study done to determine the effects of radiation on insects dates back to 1919 when W. P. Davey tested the effects of small doses of X-rays on the longevity of Tribolium confusum; surprisingly, Davey found that chronic exposure to Xrays at a dose of about 60 rads actually prolonged the life of this flour beetle. This finding evidently languished in the literature for about 37 years until a dubious J. M. Cork (1957) repeated the study under more controlled conditions and to his dismay obtained essentially the same result (concluding his paper with the remark, \\\\u201cIt is hoped that the results reported on a simple structure of this kind will not be construed as a license for X-ray practitioners to become less critical of recognized safety factors in dealing with the human organism\\\\u201d). Perhaps the most widely cited study documenting effects of radiation on insects was H. J. Muller\\\\u2019s (1927) demonstration of artificial transmutation of genes in Drosophila melanogaster; Muller essentially was the first person to induce mutations, an accomplishment that revolutionized the science of genetics. Hanson and Heys (1928) heralded the accomplishment as \\\\u201cone of the most notable events in the field of pure biology in this century\\\\u201d and extolled the virtues of the new mutagenic agent; \\\\u201con one Sunday afternoon, 40 mutations were found. Prior to the use of the X-ray, if one mutation were found in 40 Sunday afternoons the time would have been considered well spent.\\\\u201d Exposure to X-rays, radium, and other sources of radiation thus replaced the multifarious harmful agents that had been tested and found wanting as mutagens, including, among others, continuous and intermittent rotation, very high temperatures, very low temperatures, and, in one failed attempt to mutagenize white rats, 10 successive generations of daily exposure to alcohol fumes (\\\\u201cthe young of 10 generations of alcoholic ancestors were both physically and mentally the equals of the controls and in some cases slightly superior\\\\u201d).

Created in the 1980s, in the mind of a young and enthusiastic student Aaron Lansky, the Yiddish Book Center throughout the years has become a unique place on the American cultural map. Traversing the continents and crossing borders, Lansky and his co-workers for over thirty years have been saving Yiddish language books from extinction. The Center, however, has long stopped to be merely a storage house for the collection, but instead has grown into a vibrant hub of Yiddishkeit in the United States. Its employees do not only collect, distribute, digitalize and post online the forgotten volumes, but also engage in diverse activities, scholarly and cultural, that promote the survival of the tradition connected with Yiddish culture. They educate, offering internships and fellowships to students interested in learning Yiddish from across the world, translate, publish, and exhibit Yiddish language materials, in this way finding new users for the language whose speakers were virtually annihilated by the Holocaust. To honour their legacy, a separate project is aimed at conducting video interviews that record life testimonies of the speakers of Yiddish. Aaron Lansky\\\\u2019s 2004 memoir, Outwitting History, provides an interesting insight into the complexities of his arduous life mission.

The students, who ranged in age from fourteen to eighteen, had been brought there on a fieldtrip by Mark Rader, a science teacher who had hoped that exposure to the film would encourage them to think about racial injustice and discrimination (Spolar Cl). Although the Jewish Community Relations Council had prepared a study guide in conjunction with the Holocaust Center of Northern California and sent it to the Oakland School District, it did not arrive in time for Rader to use, and according to his own account, he did little to prepare the students for what they were about to see outside of warning them to be on their best behavior (Levin 3). Some students later claimed that the majority of them didn\\'t know about the Holocaust and had completed no lessons on the subject at Castlemont (Blacks and Jews). Matinee attendees that day remember the talking and laughter as going on continuously until the projector was turned off one hour into the film (BlacL\\\\u00b7 and Jews). Students and their chaperons later claimed that the behavior that caused the most outrage, a comment and laughter after a Nazi shot a female Jewish architect in the head, involved only ten of the students at the most (Spolar Cl). Among the group of offended theater patrons were Holocaust survivors, according to the theater manager (Rich 17). As the students were marched out of the theater, about half of the remaining 450 spectators burst into spontaneous applause (Mowatt AlO). Both the students and the majority of the remaining authence may have thought they could put the incident behind them and continue with their field trip or the film, but someone tipped off the local Bay Area news media, and that applause became the opening shot in a salvo of accusations and recriminations that eventually became a national scandal, culminating nearly three months later in director Steven Spielberg\\'s appearance, along with California Governor Pete Wilson, at a Castlemont school assembly. This paper examines how a conflict within an authence at a single movie screening became the subject of a national news scandal. The witness testimony I use as support should be read not as definitive accounts of the incident, but rather as symptomatic of the very discourses that generated and sustained the scandal. Since most of the interviews were made after significant attention had already been given the incident, it is impossible to determine to what extent the controversy reflected the rhetoric of the students and other authence members or vice versa. What is clear, though, is that very specific events and discourses in the contemporary historical context predisposed the media to portray the incident as an example of outrageously inappropriate and insensitive behavior by possible anti-Semitic black youth while ignoring questions of the appropriateness of the film for students that age, the educational value of the film in general, and, most crucially, the nature of ordinary youth, and particularly black youth, behavior in movie theaters. The Castlemont story appeared during a time of widespread reporting about a perceived crisis in relations between blacks and Jews. This rift had first come into the national consciousness during the 1991 series of riots that took place in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, a neighborhood largely inhabited by Hassidic Jews and Afro-Caribbeans.1 Concerns about relations between the two communities had been reactivated just a month and a half before the Castlemont incident when Khalid Abdul Muhammad, a former officer in the Nation of Islam, gave a speech at Kean College in New Jersey, during which he notoriously referred to Jews as the \\\\\"bloodsuckers of the black community\\\\\" (Martello 3). \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2009}, {\"paperId\": \"64c19a731837d30bbc746348e6c776636b877b78\", \"title\": \"Hava N\\'Halela : Tzipora Jochsberger and Her Vision for the Hebrew Arts School\", \"abstract\": \"Tzipora Jochsberger (1920\\\\u2013) educator, composer, and musicologist, dreamed of using the arts to introduce Jews to the richness of their heritage.

The experiences they endured during WWII were thought to impair their parental functioning. A trans-generational transmission of the trauma has been reported by clinicians and by researchers exploring the vulnerability of the adult offspring when facing major stressful events. However, the two previous epidemiological studies conducted so far failed to show enhanced psychopathology when the children of the Holocaust survivors were compared with suitable controls. Methods: In the Israel-component of the World Mental Health Survey offspring of Holocaust survivors were identified (N=430) and compared to offspring of Europe-born parents who did not reside in Nazi-occupied countries (N=417) on several measures of psychopathology and physical health dimensions that have a marked psychological components, and on health and mental health help-seeking practices. Results: No statistical differences were elicited between both groups on all those domains. Conclusions: Apparently, Holocaust survivor parents succeeded to spare their children from the untoward consequences of the psychological wounds and scars of their traumatic past. Survivors strived to secure a better and safer life for their children as evidenced by the relatively higher level of education that the offspring of the survivors were able to achieve than the comparison group, although their own educational career was truncated. Also, separations from parents until the end of adolescence of the children did not differ between the two groups. Research findings on the effects of the Holocaust experience on the survivors have consistently shown higher levels of psychopathology compared with adequate controls, shortly and even long after World War II ended (1, 2). Those findings were made in different countries and in studies based on clinical and community samples. Importantly, these studies were unrelated to compensation claims (1). Clinicians subsequently reported that the children of the survivors were equally affected (3\\\\u20135). This was not surprising as Holocaust survivors were suspected to be impaired in their parental functioning (6). Factors such as bereavement, the ghost of past severe traumatic experiences during and immediately after WWII, hastily contracted marriages after liberation, concern about a safe future, compounded by pogroms upon return to the original places of residence, immigration, and exposure to war-related stressors in Israel were all assumed to build an adverse scenario with regard to successful parenting (1). For example, authors raised the hypotheses that processes related to child rearing, such as separation-individuation (7) and attachment (8) might be disrupted. Today, the picture that emerges from a vast literature on the mental health of children of Holocaust survivors is more complex. Community-based epidemiological inquiries, which are not based on illness behavior, cast a doubt on the above findings (9, 10). Indeed, reviewers (11, 12) concluded that clinical and community studies fail to concur. Whereas \\\\u201c...clinical studies tend to present a specific \\\\u2018psychological profile\\\\u2019 that includes a predisposition to PTSD, various difficulties in separation-individuation and a contradictory mix of resilience and vulnerability when coping with stress...\\\\u201d (12), Isr J Psychiatry Relat Sci Vol 44 No. 2 (2007) 144\\\\u2013151 Address for Correspondence: Itzhak Levav, MD, Ministry of Health, 2 Ben Tabai Street, Jerusalem 93591, Israel. E-mail: Itzhak.Levav@moh.health.gov.il community surveys do not show that the offspring of the survivors differ from well-selected comparison populations. Admittedly, the clinical studies were not uniform with regard to their findings. As noted by reviewers, several of those studies failed to support the notion that psychopathology in the first generation is transmitted to the second. In addition, not all of the clinical studies were free from methodological shortcomings (1, 5). Yet, for many practitioners the existence or lack of existence of the \\\\u201csecond generation syndrome\\\\u201d has not reached closure, especially since a set of well designed studies have identified vulnerability factors in the offspring with regard to the reaction to stressors such as being diagnosed with breast cancer (13, 14), and exposure to war actions (15). In these cases, samples of female and male children of Holocaust survivors, respectively, showed higher measures of psychopathology than comparison groups. Analogously, Yehuda et al. found that the offspring of survivors compared to suitable comparison groups reacted to traumatic events with higher frequency of PTSD and/or other psychiatric disorders (16). Yehuda et al. also showed that the vulnerability in the offspring of Holocaust survivors expresses itself through the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis with lower cortisol levels than controls (17). In view of the contrasting findings obtained in those three different sources of data, further epidemiological exploration would seem to be fully justified provided the new study offers comparative advantages with regard to previous work in both its methodology and domains covered. The Israeli component of the World Mental Health Survey provided us with such an opportunity (18). In this community study, offspring of Holocaust survivors and of Europe-born parents who had not resided in Nazi-occupied countries were included in a large countrywide survey. The outcome variables comprised a number of factors that had not been researched in the two earlier community studies (9, 10), such as use of services, self-appraisal of health, self-reported physical health conditions, and suicidal behavior. Psychopathological domains that had been explored in those past studies, such as emotional distress and mood and anxiety disorders, complement these new measures. Methods and Procedures Survey sample selection This inquiry was nested in the Israeli component of the World Mental Health Survey (WMH). Accordingly, it followed the procedures established by the World Health Organization and Harvard University in the approximately 30 countries that participated in the survey (18). Our sample was extracted from the National Population Register (NPR) and comprised non-institutionalized de jure residents aged 21 and over. The sample was designed to reflect a distribution of respondents combining gender-agepopulation groups (Arabs, Jews: Israel-born or preand post-1990 immigrants from the former USSR). In large localities (N=73), where approximately 80% of the total population live, a one-stage stratified sample was drawn. Each stratum was defined as a combination of population group, age and gender. The records in each stratum were sorted by geographic characteristics and a systematic sample was drawn. In small localities (N=1113), a two-stage sample was drawn. First, the localities were assigned to 33 strata according to localization, size and type (e.g., village, kibbutz). A systematic sample of localities was drawn from each stratum with probability proportional to their size; 89 localities were selected, at least two localities in each stratum. In the second stage, the sampling rate was set so that the final probability of individuals was fixed across localities. A systematic sample of individuals in the sampled localities was drawn from the NPR, after sorting the records by population group, age and gender. On average, 15 respondents were selected in each locality. The interviewed sample was weighted back to the total population to compensate for unequal selection probabilities resulting from disproportionate stratification, clustering effects and non-response. The weights were adjusted to make weighted sample totals conform to known population totals taken from reliable Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) sources. Face-to-face interviews at the homes of respondents were conducted from May 2003 to April 2004.

The understanding that collective memory can be preserved only through proactive efforts led to the development of formal and informal curricula for Holocaust education. The main assumption is that Holocaust education has the potential to generate a moral transformation. In light of this conclusion the question is: What kind of changes do we seek and how should we accomplish them? This study deals with a case study of one of the constitutive historical events of the 20 century: commemoration of the Holocaust. The study focuses on the Experiential Learning Method of educating about Holocaust remembrance and commemoration and about Holocaust monuments. Over the years memorial centers have been added, which contain additional monuments commemorating the story of a specific place and/or personal stories. One of the currently customary methods of commemoration in Israel is the journey to Poland, to the labor, concentration, and death camps, to the various memorial sites and monuments. This journey is undertaken by young and old, groups and singles, from all over the world and particularly from Israel. Since many of those taking the journey are young people at an age when personal, national, and historical identity is formed, a time when the young acquire their educational values, it is particularly important to ascertain who is charged with passing on the beacon of memory. This leads to weighty questions regarding the identity of the guides who lead these journeys and the contents they choose to impart to the participants, the guidance sites, and the method of guidance. Who will tell the story? How will the story be told? What will remain of the story? This study discusses in addition, a case study of guides from Israel charged with imparting this chapter of human history. In order to explore their impact, interviews were held with 47 guides, the large majority of whom are Israeli born, a majority academics, and many hold advanced degrees. The research findings indicate that they aim the commemoration beacon primarily at guidance sites in Poland.

In Transcending Trauma Project interviews survivors noted the impact of the Holocaust was always present but some stated that it increased as they aged. A small number of children of survivors interviewed observed a dependence upon defense mechanisms to cope with aging which differed from the survivors\\\\u2019 identification of using active and family coping strategies during the war and postwar years. Though children who experienced positive parent-child relationships mentioned the negative coping strategies, they also spoke positively of the impact of their parents in their own lives and expressed empathy for their parents. In the families where tensions existed between the survivors and their children, the children did not express empathy for their aging parents. Several studies supported the importance of family relationships in the aging process.

Clifford\\\\u2019s survey of the development of memory agency since the 1970s is particularly insightful for understanding the difficulties arising for child survivors both from the testimonial framework and the rhetoric of legacies used by certain oral history projects. The construction of well-composed accounts aligned to set expectations of linear, coherent narratives with a redemptive message inevitably involves stylizing experiences and suppressing the sense of uncertainty, rupture, and loss inherent to child survivor stories. Some interviewees try to meet such audience expectations, while others choose to maintain the authenticity of their fragmented stories. In analyzing key experiences of child survivors such as the immediate postwar resettlement in pan-European and global locations, the restitution process started with the West German Federal Indemnification Law of 1953, and the late recognition of the specific child survivor status in the 1990s, Clifford impressively balances the \\\\u201ctelling\\\\u201d of the story from the children\\\\u2019s perspectives with interludes focused on the visions and expectations of the adults. There is sometimes a slight tendency to amplify the aspect of child agency and the female voice.

Years ago, as a teaching assistant in an undergraduate course in public opinion, I helped three dozen journalism majors discuss the circumstances and consequences of how the public learned tennis legend Arthur Ashe had AIDS. He wanted to keep his medical condition private; USA To day trumped his desire for privacy by publishing his condition. The students discussed the ethical and reporting dilemmas that USA Today faced. Did Ashe, as a public figure, have a right to privacy? Or does journalism have a responsibility to detail the health conditions of public figures? What about the journalists who knew Ashe had AIDS? Why did they not publish? Should they have? Without dissent, the students called USA Today\\'s actions reprehensible. \\\\\"It\\'s unfair. Journalists don\\'t know how much they hurt people,\\\\\" they said. \\\\\"It\\'s unethical. How does it serve the public?\\\\\" they asked. \\\\\"Reporters acted like piranhas,\\\\\" they said. Undergraduate indignation ruled. The professor sat silently in the front row during the hour-long discussion. Then he stood and said: \\\\\"So. You think the press treated Arthur Ashe shamelessly and without conscience.\\\\\" The class nodded, murmuring assent. \\\\\"Then why are you in a school of journalism that will socialize you to act in the very same way?\\\\\" he asked and walked from the classroom. I don\\'t know what stunned me more that day-the students\\' refusal to see any positives in the performance of the press or the professor\\'s assertion that journalism schools merely clone students with a certain set of inflexible values and professional skills that inhibit their ability to practice humanity in the context of their chosen profession. When I entered journalism, a typewriter sat on my desk. Today, as a journalism educator, a laptop computer resides there. Both journalism and journalism education have become far more complicated endeavors because of changes in social mores, technology, politics, corporate consolidation of media companies, and a perceived rise of sins represented in plagiarism and other scandals. Yet, as journalism educators, we have only so many credit-hours to teach our students what they need to know to become journalists of credibility, character, compassion, and craft. For those of us who learned our journalism in a simpler time, we may occasionally need resources that remind us of the breadth of the issues we must address in our courses. That\\'s what makes The Human Journalist and Shop Talk such valuable additions to a journalism educator\\'s library. Both, to steal the subtitle of Shop Talk \\\\\"examine the profession\\\\\" in terms of professional, ethical, and emotional competence. Shop Talk, a series of previously published excerpts from speeches, articles, text chapters, and lectures collected and edited by Jan Winburn, more readily adapts to a journalism skills course. As the Atlanta JournalConstitution\\'s Winburn says in her introduction, Shop Talk provides insight into essential news writing, editing, and interviewing skills; observations on all types of beat coverage; discussion of ethics and related issues; and a look forward into the multimedia issues journalists may face. This is not, however, merely another \\\\\"how-to\\\\\" book; rather, the essayists reveal the human side of practicing the craft as well as explaining their best practices. This is a notable difference from standard texts many educators use. Many essayists offer motivation for journalism students to strive for competence and instruction regarding the difficulty of balancing their humanity and journalistic duties.

The research findings show that all of the Survivors interviewed for this study wished to continue living, despite the loss, the suffering and the traumas they had experienced. They had different motivations for wanting to continue living and succeeding, like the need for a meaningful life, their need to belong, work, believe in ideology, to be together and achieve self fulfillment. Success meant different things to the people interviewed. The main difficulties indicated by the Survivors were emotional isolation, disturbing memories, loneliness, fear, and insecurity, the attitude of the local population to the H.Ss and absorption difficulties.

After all, what better source for hands-on advice on the subject of everlasting love and commitment than his grandparents, who had been married for 65 years? Along with his co-director Skyler Gross, Brandon set out to interview his grandparents and, in the process, inadvertently put a spotlight on what would become his family\\\\u2019s greatest revelation: That his cherished Nani and Popi kept a secret their entire lives together and that their relationship was far more complicated than anyone realized. \\\\u201cOn My Way Out: The Secret Life of Nani And Popi\\\\u201d is a must-see film in which Popi reveals that he is gay. Nani and Popi were born in Europe, met before the war and reunited in the aftermath of surviving the horrors of the Holocaust. They married, emigrated to Los Angeles and had two daughters. To the outside world, Nani and Popi embodied the American Dream. Popi always knew he was gay and says he was born into a world that didn\\\\u2019t understand human nature. Nani found out by mistake when she called a bathhouse he was supposedly visiting but was told he hadn\\\\u2019t been there that day. When she confronted him, he told her the truth. Their decision to hide the secret and continue their life together stemmed from their staunch and cherished belief that marriage is for life. No wonder their grandson looked towards them for their secret, and in doing so, uncovered a far deeper one. As altruistic as the \\\\u201cmarried for life\\\\u201d sentiment may sound, there is an underlying theme of lack of choice, which Popi articulates to his grandson, stating that his options were to either commit suicide or live in a closet. \\\\u201cI decided to live,\\\\u201d he says. This is a sentiment often echoed by Holocaust survivors, and the irony of surviving a concentration camp and still not living freely is not lost on the audience. The pure magic of this film is the portrayal of a deep and beautiful relationship that is perhaps flawed, but real and devoted. Nani gave Popi the space to be himself within the confines of societal pressures at the time, and he remained committed to their closely knit family. There is nothing phony in finding out that this marriage is not what it seemed; in fact, there is something even more compelling in discovering that their commitment to each other was life-long despite a difficult and complicated reality. Never talking about their secret was part of the deal that Nani and Popi made, but secrets weigh heavily and take their toll. At 95, Popi feels the need to unburden himself and live an authentic life to its fullest. \\\\u201cFor 90 years I was in pain and still am. Why should I take it to my grave?\\\\u201d Popi is open and forthcoming on his way out of both the closet and the material world and has come to terms with his sexuality, humanity, and true-self. Nani remains closed, having kept the secret she was hoping she\\\\u2019d take to her grave. Nani has dementia, which is perhaps a saving grace for her as the audience senses that she would never have agreed to discuss the secret otherwise. In one scene, she denies admitting to her daughter that Popi is gay. Although the revelation rocks and upends everything the family knew as true and real, the acceptance and support they provide to Nani and Popi are unconditional and profound.

The main themes of the questions in Part B include knowledge of history, relationship with the Native American community, relations with their family, and personal effects of historical trauma. In addition, the results of this study reveal that the majority of participants are grappling with the effects of Historical Trauma. Such effects manifest in feelings of anger towards the dominant cultural group, feelings of responsibility towards their cultural group, and feelings of connectedness with their Native American ancestors regardless of connectedness with one\\'s own family. Trauma symptoms in the form of traumatic dream imagery and depressive ideation were reported by the majority of participants despite the majority of participants reported growing up disconnected from their tribal cultures and customs. There was a generational difference in how participants gained knowledge of their history and culture in that all of the participants in the elder group more likely to report gaining knowledge through a family elder.

The action played a highly controversial role in the history of the Jewish self-rescue actions that elaborated in recent historiography. Instead of examining the negotiations between the SS and the Hungarian Zionist Rescue Committee, this study explores how the passengers of the Kasztner train narrated their controversial plight in their diaries, memoirs, and interviews. The inquiry seeks to uncover the history of the Kasztner action from a bottom-up perspective focusing on what was the role of news and rumors about the release in the narratives of the survivors. Hungarian Jewish families, i.e. the \\\\u201cKasztner Jews\\\\u201d aspired to travel to Palestine, landed finally in Switzerland but directly left from Nazi-occupied Hungary to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. The majority of them were spending months in a special sector of the camp between June and December 1944. The circumstances in the Hungarian Camp where the inmates were treated as \\\\u201chostages\\\\u201d by the Nazis were unusual compared to the other \\\\u2013 ordinary \\\\u2013 camp sectors of Bergen-Belsen or other concentration camps. Due to this special status, the \\\\u201cKasztner Jews\\\\u201d were not in emergency considering they did not suffer from starvation, aggression, and illnesses that lead to death. However, they were held under Nazi jurisdiction and were imprisoned by the SS, and were not convinced about their long-awaited survival.\\\\nThe accounts written during the months spent in Bergen-Belsen shed light on the flow of information between prisoners in a particular situation. Attitudes to the news and interpretations were influenced by the ideological, religious, and personal background of the \\\\u201cKasztner Jews\\\\u201d. The differences within the group determined the access to information: the Zionist leaders and their families were much more informed but everyone became part of the information network created by the participants to a certain degree. The uncertain plight and the vulnerability to the Nazis evolved ideas and visions of the possible future. The so-called rumor culture was a major phenomenon that featured everyday life. People who were consistently isolated from credible sources of information became both the creators and the consumers of the news. Besides the uncertainty, the moral ambiguity of Kasztner action was reflected in the participants\\\\u2019 narratives. Their attitudes towards the news were largely determined by the conclusions they drew about their own situation and future, which were influenced not only by their political orientation but also by their family situation. The condition of the prisoners from Auschwitz aroused sympathy and pity among them. On the other hand, the poor physical condition of these prisoners reinforced their privileged position. News of potential deportation from Budapest was also at the center of the discussions. Those who feared for their family members and relatives who were on the train and those who stayed in Budapest were trapped. When they heard the good news, they were glad that family members who stayed in Budapest were secure from deportation. At the same time, the distressing news reinforced their decision to leave the country.

Saidel. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 2006. 279 pp. $21.90. As the number of Holocaust survivors who are able to tell their histories decreases, the urgency increases to leave a record of their experiences. It is this that has motivated Dr. Rochelle Saidel to document the experiences of the inmates of Ravensbriick concentration camp and, in particulat, those of the Jewish inmates of Ravensbriick. In so doing, she has provided a well-researched account that is valuable both to scholars of the Holocaust and to friends and descendants of the Jewish women of Ravensbruck. Dr. Saidel is the founder of the Remember the Women Institute, which is dedicated to the remembrance of the women of Ravensbriick and to the continued historical research of this unique camp and its enormously strong inmate population. This book exemplifies the purpose of this Institute. In parallel to the narratives of the survivors is the narrative of the struggle to realize the Jewish identity of the inmates through history and through recognition at the Mahn- und Gedenhtatte Ravensbruck. Dr. Saidel began making contact with the survivors at the 50th anniversary of the camp\\'s liberation in 1995. She was able to contact other Jewish survivors with the assistance of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, which provided a mailing list of survivors as well as a cover letter for her initial contact. From this list of 300 survivors, Dr. Saidel received sixty replies, with most women completing the questionnaire and often supplying additional names. Dr. Saidel has interviewed many of these Jewish survivors and their descendants in Brazil, Europe, the U.S., and Israel. Of the 132,000 prisoners of Ravensbriick, 117,000 were killed or died there. Jewish women were a minority among the inmates of Ravensbriick, comprising about 20 percent of die population, and their story has heretofore never been told. And although there are memorials to these prisoners at Ravensbruck, they are grouped according to nationality. As recendy as 1980, the Jewish prisoners were not memorialized separately but together with their fellow inmates of a nation, with often inappropriate results-the Polish Jews were memorialized as a part of all Polish prisoners in a room with a large crucifix. It was this lack of singular identification that motivated Dr. Saidel to begin her research into the lives, and often deaths, of the Jewish inmates of Ravensbriick. Now there is a Jewish memorial at the camp, and this book, too, serves as a memorial to these women. Beginning with a history of the camp, Dr. Saidel describes what she refers to as \\\\\"a special hell for women.\\\\\" Indeed, Ravensbruck was unique in that it was built for female resisters and political prisoners. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2007}, {\"paperId\": \"6b8a0a95bf454659751c3696ca7c7203634a451c\", \"title\": \"\\\\\"Hoffentlich werde ich taugen.\\\\\" Zu Situation und Kontext von Brigitte Schwaiger/Eva Deutsch Die Galizianerin\", \"abstract\": \"The article explores the situation, post-Holocaust Viennese society and rising anti-Semitism in Waldheim-Austria, and the background against which Schwaiger, an established mainstream Austrian author, writes the life history of Deutsch, a Holocaust survivor from Silesia whose native language is Yiddish.

A continuum, with classic survivors on one end of the scale and contemporary survivors on the other is therefore suggested as the best way to understand the differences between the two cohorts of Holocaust survivors in this study. Research findings compare and contrast these two ends of the continuum, as well as the cases which fit somewhere in the middle, and suggest the following five themes: 1. There are important similarities and differences between classic and contemporary survivors, 2. Individual Holocaust survivors, their family members and the larger community have all been affected by the Holocaust, 3.

For the Holocaust survivor who calls himself Ka-Tzetnik 135633 (Con centration-Camp Inmate 135633), however, pseudonymous publication has served just the opposite function: it forces readers to confront what he presents as the one and only significant aspect of who he is.

This is not how most people today measure their own success or that of their family or country. For the academic, the more familiar measures of success include tenure, academic rank, number of publications, citation count, and that most important of all measures, annual salary. Political and economic analysts have similar measures for the success of countries: annual GDP growth, political influence, military power, literacy rates, and the like.Biologists are the only profession that measures success the way Abraham, his mentor, and the author of the Book of Genesis did. Rabbits are a successful species because they are plentiful, and the California condor is unsuccessful because the species is teetering on the brink of extinction. Ecologists use number of individuals and total biomass as quantitative measures of species success. In evolutionary and medical genetics, the success of a gene is defined by its fitness: average number of offspring surviving to reproductive age for gene carriers, divided by average number of surviving offspring in the general population.In the study of human diversity, the important units are cultural, religious, ethnic, linguistic and racial groups. Abraham\\'s tribe is one of them: one of the world\\'s most successful, as evidenced by its survival through three millennia. On page 297 of this issue, Jelena Cvorovic and Kosta Nikolic present the most detailed study yet about the demography of Serbian Jews. Their subjects are the human equivalent of an endangered species. As detailed in their article, close to 80% of the Serbian Jewish population were wiped out in the holocaust, followed by emigration to Israel of many of the 6000 survivors. Less than 2000 remain today. Cvorovic personally interviewed about 30% of them, and gained insights into the circumstances of their demographic decline. While the horrors of the holocaust were obviously the main reason, additional factors include emigration, low fertility, secularism leading to disassociation from the remaining Jewish community, and intermarriage with non-Jews. The authors also observe that Jews have made contributions to culture, politics and the economy in Serbia that are out of proportion to their small numbers. In a separate study on page 352 of this issue, Lynn and Cvorovic offer a plausible explanation for these outstanding achievements: high average intelligence of the Serbian Jews.It is instructive to compare the Serbian Jews with another ethnic group that has been studied by Cvorovic in great detail (see book review on page383of this issue): the Roma, also known as Gypsies. Although decimated by Nazi persecution (though not as profoundly as the Jews), the Roma in Serbia and the other Balkan countries are thriving - demographically, at least. In her recent book about this group, Cvorovic (2014) observes that fertility rates of the Balkan Roma, though declining, are about twice those of the non-Roma population. In consequence, their proportion in the ethnic mix of the Balkan countries is rising despite their higher mortality. By this measure, the Roma are perhaps the most successful indigenous European group today. Although demographic particulars are uncertain, Cvorovic estimates the present sizes of Roma minorities as between 1% and 5% in most Balkan countries. The Roma do less well on other measures of success, with high rates of poverty and unemployment and the lowest IQs measured in any modern European population (Cvorovic and Lynn, 2014; Dumitrascu, 1998). \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2015}, {\"paperId\": \"6efea40272faff40909f5898783254b6957d8729\", \"title\": \"Psychological-Mindedness and American Indian Historical Trauma: Interviews with Service Providers from a Great Plains Reservation.\", \"abstract\": \"The concept of historical trauma (HT) was developed to explain clinical distress among descendants of Jewish Holocaust survivors and has since been ascribed new meanings to account for suffering in diverse contexts.

A form of projective identification is proposed as an explanatory mechanism which brings together diverse aspects of the observed phenomena: projection by the parent of Holocaust-related feelings and anxieties into the child; introjection by the child as if she herself had experienced the concentration camps; and return of this input by the child in the form of compliant and solicitous behaviour associated with enmeshment and individuation problems.

Narratives, both oral and written, play an important role in helping the individual make sense of their lives and the world they live in. Narrative research is focused on the elicitation and interpretation of people\\\\u2019s narrative accounts of their lived experiences. In recent decades, there has been an enormous growth in the use of narrative inquiry and narrative-based research with diverse theoretical orientations and methodologies grounded in various disciplines of the social sciences and humanities including anthropology, psychology, psycholinguistics, sociology, history and literary studies as well as in medicine and clinical research (Chase, 2005, 2011; Holstein & Gubrium, 2012; Kleinman, 1988; Charon, 2006). According to Chase (2005), most narrative researchers treat narrative as a distinctive form of discourse that shapes meaning through the concerted ordering of story material with speakers providing particular understandings of personal action and experiences by organizing events and objects into meaningful patterns, connecting subjects, actions, events, and their consequences over time. \\\\nAs narrative research has become increasingly complex and rigorous, this special issue was planned to gain insight into the narrative research being conducted by international scholars with a focus on women and trauma, broadly defined. The call for papers attracted many high-quality submissions from authors representing various countries. The special issue contains a collection of ten papers, each providing a unique perspective and understanding of trauma in women\\\\u2019s lives and its reflection in narrative inquiry. Just as women\\\\u2019s voices are varied, so too are the narratives presented. Women are represented as narrators; as subjects of the narration and as characters in the narrative. The authors also present a broad spectrum of approaches to the empirical analysis of narrative material ranging from social media content, life stories, clinical and educational interventions, and literary works. \\\\u00a0 \\\\nIn the first paper of the special issue, Bifulco\\\\u2019s article seeks to explore links between selected investigative child abuse interview accounts using narratives elicited through the Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse (CECA) clinical interview guide and analyzed using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Counts (LIWC) text analysis programme (Francis & Pennebaker, 1992) which identifies characteristics of speech associated with trauma. Her paper examines the potential of combining these approaches to systematically analyze and interpret trauma narratives. \\\\nIn the second article, the contextual backdrop for the narratives is the COVID-19 pandemic. In her article, Kostruba analyzes narratives collected online to gain an understanding of how specific social restrictions, stay-at-home orders particular to the pandemic affected all aspects of life including psychological well-being. Her study also used LIWC psycholinguistic analysis of these current pandemic narratives to identify markers of traumatic experience and identify possible gender differences in the ways women experienced (and continue to experience) the COVID-19 global pandemic. \\\\nThe importance of social and cultural context is apparent in the next article which draws on literary texts as the source material. For Aguilar Lopez & Miguel Borge, the drama The Gold Ribbon by Mar\\\\u00eda Manuela Reina, written and situated in the 1980s, a decade that for Spain implied a more obvious abandonment of the most traditional conceptions of the role of women, serves as the unit of analysis. The authors describe the divergent worldview models of the older versus younger characters, reflecting both a generational and gender divide around topics such as success, infidelity, and matrimony. Aguilar Lopez & Miguel Borge aim to identify if, how and why the dramatist is able to reach out to the general public through her play to create social awareness and give voice to the women who rebelled against the traditional social and gender roles. \\\\nThe next paper in this series focuses on the emerging field of post-traumatic growth (PTG) defined by Tedeschi & Calhoun (2004) as a \\\\u201cpositive psychological change experienced as a result of the struggle with highly challenging circumstances.\\\\u201d Drawing on therapeutic narratives from women participating in a psychotherapy workshop, Lushyn & Sukhenko utilize dialectical understanding and discourse analysis to identify and assess the women\\\\u2019s descriptions and definitions associated with post-traumatic development and growth with a further attempt to provide practical implications for psychological practice. \\\\nA set of the articles (#5-7) in this special issue target traumas associated with transition, be it gender transition or women and girls transitioning to another life phase (adolescence; menopause) and the emotional, social and cultural experiences connected to these transitions. \\\\nMartynyuk\\\\u2019s article combines methodological tools of conceptual metaphor theory and narrative psychology with theoretical assumptions of the intersubjective psycholinguistic approach to meaning making and exploring transgender transition narrative metaphors. Her dataset consists of 16 TED talks videos by transgender individuals discussing their experiences of transitioning which provide Martynyuk the opportunity to conduct a narrative and visual analysis of the metaphors that are given coherence by the textual, social, cultural, and historical context of the narrative, as well as by the interactive situational context reflected in the video recordings. \\\\nThe article by Nair & George puts the menopausal woman as the focus of the narrative inquiry. The authors interviewed a group of male spouses about their knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about perimenopause and their experiences associated with the physical, psychological, and social changes occurring in the lives of their wives. The menopausal transition can be a period of stress, even lead to trauma if left unnoticed or unsupported. Nair & George used qualitative data software to analyze the interview data and thematic analysis to arrive at themes which could inform programs which could raise awareness about the perimenopausal and menopausal life stages of women to help both partners understand and cope with the individual, family and societal changes which occur during this life period. \\\\nOn the opposite end of the life spectrum, Shirazi et al, investigate whether narrative-based interventions in the school context can increase children\\\\u2019s emotional intelligence (EI) and whether oral and written narrative elements have a different effect on students\\' EI. The underlying premise is that children share their emotional experiences through narratives and stories and high-quality narratives are beneficial for children\\\\u2019s wellbeing and development. The research project was conducted with almost one hundred 12-year old Iranian girls who attend Yasuj city schools in southwestern Iran.

Ideally, it gives the interviewee space to explore and express her or his memories and the connections between them, while emphasizing the context of the experience of violence within a larger life lived. There is, however, an inherent tension in setting out to interview someone about her or his life, as he or she understands it, while being, at the same time, specifically interested in her or his experience of violence. The latter interest immediately categorizes, directs, and betrays a particular understanding of the former: namely, that a person\\\\u2019s life can be interpreted through the lens of one particular set of experiences within it. This article examines two oral history projects that I conducted with survivors of atrocity\\\\u2014one with survivors of World War II and the Bosnian war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the other with Holocaust survivors in Montreal\\\\u2014to explore the limits of framing lives within the context of violence, and to ask how they might be overcome methodologically, ethically, and philosophically. In these projects, some interviewees struggled with not being survivors \\\\u201cenough\\\\u201d to merit being interviewed, and others felt that they were so much more than survivors that such a framing frustrated them. How can we understand someone\\\\u2019s experience and memory of violence without defining her or him, and the interview space, by it? Is a life history project that is interested in memories of atrocity necessarily restrictive and directive, no matter how broadly it tries to present itself? As we oral historians are increasingly concerned with how we understand, interpret, and represent the people to whom we listen, it is crucial to consider this question of framing.\", \"year\": 2018}, {\"paperId\": \"73098aaa2e5199acbce24d6ffed2d20124734772\", \"title\": \"Between Witness and Testimony: Survivor Narratives and the Shoah\", \"abstract\": \"The disaster is related to forgetfulnessforgetfulness without memory, the motionless retreat of what has not been treated . To write . . . is to be in relation, through words in their absence, with what one cannot remember. (Blanchot 1995,121) \\\\\"When you\\'re hungry, it gets to a point where you don\\'t mind stealing from your own sister, from your own father ... Now I-you would never picture me, and I can\\'t even imagine myself doing that now. But it happened.\\\\\" (Leon W, FVA tape T-2)1 In the last several years, a number of groups and individuals have made an effort to record the memories of those who survived, in one way or another, the utter burn of history. Two of the most notable are the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies at Yale University, established in 1982, and the Survivors of the Shoah Foundation, established with the help of Steven Spielberg in 1994. In addition to recorded oral testimonies, we have those gathered much earlier, recorded with paper and ink: Primo Levi began writing If This is a Man (which, in its later printing, became Survival in Auschwitz) in 1948, less than four years after the liberation of Auschwitz, and countless others have committed to language the memories that haunted them and the realities that confronted them as they were starved, beaten, and left to watch one another be killed or die. In the case of both written and oral testimonies, in spite of the prima facie differences between them, it becomes clear that the distance between what has been witnessed and what can be committed to testimony-what was seen and what can be said-is often wide, but always palpable. And it is palpable not only in the witness\\'s statements but in the shrugged shoulders, the winces, the tears, and the silences that punctuate the oral testimonies and that are aestheticized but not domesticated in the written language of figure. Nathan A\\'s description of an aktion, in which Jewish villagers are asked to dig ditches and then line up at its edge to be shot, along with, later, all of their neighbors, proceeds this way: They used to throw the earth on the top, and the earth used to go up and down because they are living people: One-the son bury his mother; the mother was still alive: \\\\\"Moyshe, ikh lebh; bagrub mikh nisht lebedikerheyt\\\\\" (\\\\\"Moyshe, I\\'m alive; don\\'t bury me while I\\'m alive\\\\\"]. . . . But Moyshe had no choice, because the Germans no give him the choice. And he bury alive. [Interviewer:] He buried his mother alive? (FVA tape T-113) At that, Nathan shrugs his shoulders without any facial expression. The shrug of the shoulders and the lack of apparent emotion in this account, as much as the incongruous connection of the pleading of a mother to her son and the statement bereft of anything but description that concludes the episode (\\\\\"and he bury alive\\\\\"), mark a point between witness and testimony that can be seen as a moment of trauma, a moment in which the historical real and the memory of it as demanded by the imperative to testify to it disintegrate and present for both the witness and the interviewer (as well as those who are present to view or listen to the testimony) a break.This moment, this break, is neither a site of historical facticity nor a kernel of \\\\\"truth\\\\\" nor the recovery, for the witness, of the moment by way of memory. It is, in Cathy Caruth\\'s words, a moment in which the object-in this case, the moment not of the son burying his mother, but of Nathan A.\\'s witnessing of the acts he attempts to describe--is \\\\\"grasped only in the very inaccessibility of its occurrence\\\\\" (1991, 187) in which the object is denoted not by the words but is borne by the shrug, the connective \\\\\"and:\\' and the impassive face of Nathan A. as he confronts the interviewer. In Binjamin Wilkomirski\\'s Fragments: Memories of a Wartime Childhood, there are equally devastating moments in which the writer presents his reader with incomprehensibly painful and quite literally unbelievable moments of cruelty In one, the boy Binjamin-perhaps a pseudonym for a Jewish child who in 1944 is no more than five or six, and who finds himself separated from his brothers and transported to Majdanek-recalls what happens to two young boys who are caught soiling their already-fouled bunks: They were forbidden to come back into the barracks. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2000}, {\"paperId\": \"742d5bda6ce4ea63b5ea15280caff06a144fb4d0\", \"title\": \"Disorganizing Experiences in Second- and Third-Generation Holocaust Survivors\", \"abstract\": \"Second-generation Holocaust survivors might not show direct symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder or attachment disorganization, but are at risk for developing high levels of psychological distress.

Based on in-depth interviews with 196 second-generation parents and their adolescent children, three themes of disorganizing experiences carried across generations were identified: focus on survival issues, lack of emotional resources, and coercion to please the parents and satisfy their needs. These themes reflect the frustration of three basic needs: competence, relatedness, and autonomy, and this frustration becomes disorganizing when it involves stability, potency, incomprehensibility, and helplessness.

Failure to integrate also leads to nonrealization of the traumatic experience.

Their interviews were analyzed in terms of structural dissociation and nonrealization in order to develop a narrative about the stages of their post-war lives.

Although the authorship is unknown, this prisoner\\'s words hold considerable weight. In English, the phrase translates to \\\\\"If there is a God, He will have to beg my forgiveness.\\\\\" (1) Religious victims of the Holocaust were confronted with the ultimate test of faith. The majority of these victims were the European Jews. Having already been a tormented demographic for thousands of years, they were faced with complete obliteration at the beginning of the Second World War, a time when antisemitism took on its most horrifying form. (2) One of the essential teachings of Judaism is the belief that God is omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent. If God were truly omniscient, or \\\\\"all-knowing,\\\\\" He surely must have been aware of the imminent death of eleven million human beings, six million of which were his chosen people. If He were really omnipotent, or \\\\\"all-powerful,\\\\\" He would have been able to stop the atrocities. And, if God were indeed omnibenevolent, or \\\\\"all-good,\\\\\" how could He have simply stood by while these atrocities occurred? These inconsistencies have given rise to an ongoing philosophical and theological debate among Jewish thinkers. Holocaust theology, a new realm of Jewish philosophy, seeks to explain the behavior and role of God in light of the Shoah. These discussions are composed of religious responses to the problems of suffering and unwarranted evil. Worthwhile engagement in these types of theological arguments requires the consideration of many perspectives, especially of those who were eyewitnesses to the depravity. The survivors of the Holocaust who have graciously supplied their testimonies have concurrently provided various outlets of interpretation concerning the nature, or even existence of God. In his 1980 publication, The Faith and Doubt of Holocaust Survivors, Reeve Brenner, an American Reform rabbi, commented on the importance of survivor testimonial material in field of Jewish studies. In the absence of studies on general Jewish attitudes, the thoughtful and often deeply moving testimonies of survivors provide us with important insights into the nature of Judaism in the post-Holocaust world. And until careful surveys are conducted, survivors will not be speaking for themselves alone: They represent a sensitive barometer of contemporary Jewish beliefs and behavior, not only concerning the Holocaust but on a wide variety of issues. Here is telling proof that the terrible experiences of Auschwitz made victims of the Holocaust acutely aware of the existential condition of man in general and the Jew in particular. (3) With so few survivors left, eyewitness accounts are crucial to keep research in this area alive. In recent decades, the accessibility of survivor testimonies has significantly increased. Shortly after the release of Schindler\\'s List, Steven Spielberg established the Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education at the University of Southern California. The Foundation\\'s Visual History Archive contains 107,000 hours of video documentation of roughly 52,000 eyewitness interviews conducted during the mid to late 1990s. (4) The testimonies used in this paper have been carefully sifted out of this invaluable collection of interviews. Although the personal accounts of survivors are abundant and often quite detailed, anecdotal source material must always be utilized with caution. Indeed, human memory is of better service to anthropological, sociological, and philosophical analysis, rather than historicity. Accordingly, the survivor testimonies in this work will be examined alongside a researched historical narrative. Each man, woman, and child\\'s experience with unrelenting wickedness varies. While some Jewish survivors have discovered a newfound strength in their faith, others have abandoned their beliefs entirely. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2015}, {\"paperId\": \"7816c40178520fdc0b618a7211a6451d5473073c\", \"title\": \"Issues and Interpersonal Values among Three Generations in Families of Holocaust Survivors\", \"abstract\": \"This study looks at how three generations in Israeli families of Holocaust survivors work through the past.

The Gulag is typically left out of Western histories of traumatic memory in the twentieth century. Gheith argues that this omission is connected to the silence around the Gulag in Russia and to the fact that the dominant models for traumatic memory are based on the Holocaust, an experience that does not fit for Gulag survivors. Many trauma theorists place narrative (telling the story) at the center of healing from trauma. Yet, for some 50 years after the height of Stalin\\'s purges, Gulag survivors risked severe punishment if they discussed their experiences in the labor camps so that this kind of narrative approach was not open to them. One of the major effects of the enforced silence, Gheith argues, is that absent the narrative option, Gulag survivors developed creative, non-narrative ways to deal with their memories and experiences. Deploying a case study methodology, Gheith argues for the need to include the Gulag in discourse on traumatic memory and to seriously consider modes of healing or repair that are not primarily organized around narrative.\", \"year\": 2007}, {\"paperId\": \"786c038c8eecc6653e136a88329daa0f921e8d14\", \"title\": \"Influences of maternal and paternal PTSD on epigenetic regulation of the glucocorticoid receptor gene in Holocaust survivor offspring.\", \"abstract\": \"OBJECTIVE\\\\nDifferential effects of maternal and paternal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been observed in adult offspring of Holocaust survivors in both glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity and vulnerability to psychiatric disorder.

Blood samples were collected for analysis of GR-1F promoter methylation and of cortisol levels in response to low-dose dexamethasone, and two-way analysis of covariance was performed using maternal and paternal PTSD as main effects.

Fart I briefly introduces concepts important to Jewish religion and culture while Part Il consists of data from music therapists who work clinically with Jewish people gathered through questionnaires and interviews regarding their uses of music and approaches to religious and cultural matters specific to this minority group. Fart Il also emphasizes practical clinical issues and has implications for clinical practice with a variety of Jewish people and people from other groups in many music therapy settings. A number of years ago, a brief article appeared in a city newspaper describing a music therapy session with older adults. During the group, one member asked the young music therapist to hear Wagner\\'s \\\\\"Ride of the Valkyries,\\\\\" and she honored the request. As Wagner\\'s music streamed into the room, a woman in the group began to scream. She refused to speak for the next two days. After the session, the music therapist learned that the woman was Jewish and a survivor of the Holocaust in Europe that killed 6 million Jewish people. The Nazis used Wagner\\'s music as a torture device (Moreno, 1999). Although unrealistic to expect mastery of all cultures, this episode exemplifies the need for music therapists in the pluralistic society of the United States to enhance their cultural expertise and to incorporate knowledge and sensitivity regarding different cultures, religions, values, and perspectives into music therapy practice. The purpose of this article is to describe the cultural, religious practices, and music of the Jewish population in the United States and how those influence current practice of music therapy and client responses in music therapy. One of the primary aims is to emphasize the diversity that exists within the broad categorization of clients affiliating with the Jewish religion and culture in order to enhance understanding applicable to appropriate uses of music and to spark insight into considerations when working with clients from other cultures or religious groups. Part I: A Brief Overview of the Jewish Population in the United States Describing a Croup Terminology. Jew. Judaism. Jewish. Jewish religion. Culturally Jewish. There are many words associated with the definition of this group, and questions loom about how to utilize these terms (Whitfield, 1999). Disagreement over terms such as \\\\\"race,\\\\\" \\\\\"people,\\\\\" \\\\\"nation,\\\\\" and \\\\\"ethnicity\\\\\" exists (Levitt & Balkin, 2003; Schlossberger & Hecker, 1998). There is clear acknowledgement of a Jewish religion. There are people who practice \\\\\"Judaism.\\\\\" People who identify with the culture and customs or follow the religion may consider themselves \\\\\"Jewish\\\\\" or \\\\\"Jews.\\\\\" The use of the term \\\\\"Jewish\\\\\" is not meant to suggest a singular manner in which all of the people encompassed by this label incorporate Jewish religion, background, or culture into their lives. Rather, it can serve as a foundational identifier for this minority group from which further subdivisions and nuances can then be described. How people define their \\\\\"Jewishness\\\\\" may vary person to person as the Jewish population is not a homogenous group. Demographics. Considering people whose religion is or includes Judaism, have at least one Jewish grandparent, or have a Jewish upbringing, it is reported that there are approximately 5.2 million Jewish people living in the United States, constituting about 1.8% of the country\\'s total population (National Jewish Population Survey, 2003).

It was too late and it was no longer the priority. However, since the war and genocide came to an end, in July 1994, debates have continued to this day about the number of victims claimed by the conflict.

This is an uneven breakdown, and while Jacobs was open about her sample she did not declare it as a limitation of her study. Likewise, questions might be raised about Jacobs\\\\u2019s methods. She discusses her methodology clearly, but omits any description of coding, or how she arrived at her themes, which would have enriched the discussion that follows. Most particularly, I wanted to know how common each finding was.

The rating scales included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; Clinical Global Impression (CGI); Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE); Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, Form 2; and Structured Interview for Disorders of Extreme Stress. Full pre- and postinterview data were available for 21 patients.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRESULTS\\\\nThirty-eight percent of the patients met the criteria for PTSD at the first interview, compared with only 19% at the second interview. The patients had significant reductions in functional impairment and in the severity and intensity of all posttraumatic symptom clusters (intrusion, avoidance, hyperarousal); the avoidance cluster showed the most reduction. Eleven subjects had an improvement of 30% or more in total posttraumatic severity score.

At its centre, Langer\\\\u2019s body of work over five decades emphasizes the anti-redemptive experiences and \\\\u2018choiceless choices\\\\u2019 of those who survived the Holocaust. He underscores how testimony can begin to reveal what life was like for witnesses under circumstances that systematically undermined moral and ethical values. Rather than imposing heroic or healing narratives on testimonies, his analytical approach is directed towards training our eyes and ears to how witnesses express the anguished, humiliated, and shattered aspects of their experiences. While it is impossible for anyone other than a survivor to fully comprehend what he or she went through, Langer makes the compelling case that interviewers and audiences are nonetheless obliged to try to understand survivors, all the while acknowledging the impossibility of doing so. In that sense, Langer foregrounds the paradoxical nature of giving and receiving testimonies. He advocates for modes of intimately conducting and interpreting testimonies with witnesses without being appropriative of their experiences; while deeply invested in receiving the testimonies of others, he nonetheless recognizes the experiential rift that separates witnesses from those who bear witness to their recollections. This essay foregrounds the importance of Langer\\\\u2019s explorations of the lacunae and tensions that mark testimonies, particularly as they manifest in the interplay between \\\\u2018common memory\\\\u2019 and \\\\u2018deep memory.\\\\u2019 Langer\\\\u2019s analysis of that dynamic profoundly shapes not only the ways we document and interpret testimonies of the Holocaust, but also those of other genocides.\", \"year\": 2020}, {\"paperId\": \"822eb56bc52f5b93ea50cf1f94b323b205492321\", \"title\": \"Epistemic competitions over Jewish Holocaust survivors\\\\u2019 stories in interviews\", \"abstract\": \"In this article, we scrutinise epistemic competitions in interviews about World War II.

Jane Schapiro is a freelance writer and poet who lives in the Washington area. During the late 1990s she gained access to one of the legal teams that brought a class action against Swiss banks accused of pocketing the \\\\\"dormant\\\\\" accounts of Jews who perished at the hands of the Nazis and profiting from slave labor and transactions that helped the Third Reich wage war and genocide. To reconstruct the class action she draws on congressional hearings, court transcripts, and documents collected for the case as well as interviews with several lawyers on both sides. Some lawyers, especially in Switzerland, declined to assist her; others preferred to remain anonymous. Her chief informant was Michael Hausfeld, and this book is very much his tale. It is not a rounded account of the furor that engulfed Switzerland in 1995-2000. Although Schapiro deftly sketches in the background, key players such as Stuart Eizenstat do not appear until midway through the saga. We learn a lot about Hausfeld\\'s emotional gyrations, but little about the state of mind of Ed Fagan, who assembled the other major legal team in the action. Schapiro presents a sympathetic portrait of Hausfeld, whom Eizenstat describes as \\\\\"unpredictable and at times unreasonable.\\\\\" Hausfeld had an impressive record of litigating against big corporations and was sensitized to Nazi-era issues. The plight of elderly survivors rebuffed by implacable bankers enraged him, and he was prepared to work pro bono to help them achieve justice. But he had wider ambitions, too. He wanted to prove that Swiss banks had knowingly benefited from genocide and helped to prolong the war. Hausfeld was beaten to the court room by Ed Fagan, who filed a similar class action, although more narrowly focused. Fagan and Hausfeld eventually joined forces, but it was a fractious relationship. Hausfeld disliked Fagan\\'s flamboyant style. Fagan suspected that Hausfeld was content to litigate endlessly because he didn\\'t have to worry about collecting fees. Hausfeld wanted to prove that Switzerland violated \\\\\"customary international law,\\\\\" while Fagan had far more limited objectives. Hausfeld was prepared to work with the WJC, while Fagan feared it wanted to monopolize the distribution of any court settlement. It was not without reason that Eizenstat described the lawyers\\' joint team as \\\\\"a witches brew of egos and mutual jealousies.\\\\\" Schapiro explains how Hausfeld and his colleagues built their case, and she is frank about its weaknesses. For all the labor of researchers in the National Archives the lawyers for the plaintiffs had no idea how many \\\\\"dormant\\\\\" accounts there might be. Nor could they prove how much wealth actually flowed into Switzerland as a result of Nazi looting, the exploitation of slave labor, and profits on wartime transactions. The connections between Swiss banks and slave labor were tenuous. Under pressure from the WJC the banks conceded an independent audit, but its chairman, Paul Volcker, refused to share its findings with the class action lawyers. They might obtain documents via the process of \\\\\"discovery,\\\\\" but only if Judge Edward Korman, appointed to hear the case, let it go to trial. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2005}, {\"paperId\": \"85005ac53a7e4dc9a160066df9d918f3bb6aabfe\", \"title\": \"CHILDREN IN GENOCIDE EXTREME TRAUMATIZATION AND AFFECT REGULATION\", \"abstract\": \"Reaching retirement, war children those who were children during the Second World War have begun to look back and are now finally trying to work through their experiences.

For four years, I (Carolyn) have met with Jerry Rawicki; for three years, I (Chris) have held conversations with Sal Wainberg (until his death, February 22, 2012). Initially Carolyn conducted traditional oral history interviews with Sal and Jerry, which provided a concentrated chronology of the survivors\\' experiences before, during, and after the Holocaust. This information proved an invaluable foundation for us as we continued with more interactional meetings that fol- lowed the trajectory of survivors\\' current lives. In these conversations, we paid attention to how \\\\\"then\\\\\" (the Holocaust) plays into their experiences \\\\\"now\\\\\" (later in life) and how \\\\\"now\\\\\" relates to restorying \\\\\"then.\\\\\" Through compassionate conversations we provided an opportunity for Jerry and Sal to tell their past and current stories in multiple and new ways. In the process, we discovered new plotlines and insights together.We also reflected with Jerry and Sal on the meaningful and collaborative relationship we were developing. Though our focus was on them, we shared our vulnerable stories, learning from them about ourselves, and becoming more supportive as our conversations deepened. As collaborative researchers, we (Chris and Carolyn) also stayed in conversation with each other about how to work compassionately with participants (Patti, \\\\\"Sharing\\\\\" ). How could we build relationships with those we interviewed, be present in their lives when they had troubles, and feel we were making a difference by passing on their stories?Our work follows the principles expressed and demonstrated by Bud Goodall and Nick Trujillo, who made a case for research that tells stories about everyday practices and individual and collective meanings (Goodall, \\\\\"Writing\\\\\"; Pacanowsky and O\\'Donnell-Trujillo). Both wrote compassionate and vulnera- ble stories about illness, grief, love, and loss. Their exemplary stories included Goodall\\'s blog about living and dying as well as he could with pancreatic cancer (\\\\\"The Daily Narrative\\\\\") and Trujillo\\'s book with his wife about coping with her illness and death from ovarian cancer (Vande Berg and Trujillo). For Bud and Nick, research should embrace the mysteries of life and focus on what Goodall (\\\\\"Writing\\\\\" 63) calls \\\\\"human stories,\\\\\" rather than turn subjects into objects. They were not afraid to take risks or to \\\\\"ask the big questions about life,\\\\\" linking them to how we \\\\\"can understand [our lives] in this cosmos, on this blue planet, a bit better\\\\\" (Goodall, \\\\\"Writing\\\\\" 187). In their research, they took into account the social and dialogical nature of communication and our connections with events and persons we study. Their stories of love and loss, written with humility and heart, provided access to their experiences so that we might call on them as companions as we try to work through our own struggles with more grace, dignity, and humanity. They believed, as do we, that research should contribute to making the world a better place, even through relatively small acts in the everyday worlds in which we cohabit.After presenting our participants, we introduce compassionate listening and then enter the heart of our work, two stories about our interactions with Sal and Jerry. These stories demonstrate the intimacy of our relationships as we focus on the situations these two survivors find themselves in at this later stage of life-for Jerry, grief over losing his wife; for Sal, his cancer and desire to be listened to at the end of life. After the stories, we construct a conversation that grapples with what we learned about compassionate interviewing, our relationships with Jerry and Sal, and the reciprocal impact of the Holocaust and compassionate storytelling.The ParticipantsSal Wainberg was almost four years old when Germany invaded his shtetl of ? \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2014}, {\"paperId\": \"87784b204344954594a9f111440aac780e286eab\", \"title\": \"Jews in Germany after the Holocaust: Memory, Identity, and Jewish German Relations, by Lynn Rapaport\", \"abstract\": \"Jews in Germany after the Holocaust: Memory, Identity, and Jewish German Relations, by Lynn RapaportA few years back I received a DAAD grant to do research in Germany. I told an older colleague the news and his reaction surprised me. He said that I could take such a grant, I was young enough, but he couldn\\'t take money from Germans or spend a year in Germany. The reason for the difference in our attitudes was the Holocaust. For him, it was an event of first-hand experience, whereas for me it was inevitably history.This story is relevant, since the difference in attitudes of two generations frames the subject of this book, which focuses its attention on the views of Germany, Germans, and Jewry in Germany of second-generation Jews, i.e., children of survivors. From interviews carried out by Ms. Rapaport, we find a similar pattern. The parents, who experienced the Holocaust and are now in their sixties and seventies, have a more restrictive conception of relations between Jews and Germans. They do not want their children to socialize with Germans, preferring their children to take Jewish spouses and bring up Jewish children. Nevertheless, the majority of young adult Jews living in Germany have friendships with Germans and interact with them extensively, often intermarrying.Despite the dramatic title, which evokes stirrings of anxiety and consternation -- Jews, Germany, Holocaust -- the issues brought up here are actually mundane. One reads the testimony of a man who wonders if he got good grades in school because he was a Jew (p. 114), a man who bickers with his parents over going out with non-Jewish girls (p. 210), and a woman who feels embarrassed about her Jewishness in front of strangers (p. 181).The narrative gets a wee bit racier with the statement of a Jewish man who found out his girlfriend\\'s father was in the SS, and the viewpoint of a Jewish girl who prefers non-Jewish guys for sex (p. 229). Outside of these unusual testimonies, the vast majority tell a repetitive story: parents do not approve of socializing with non-Jews; young Jews, despite their successful entrance into German life, harbor feelings of alienation, feel uncomfortable with German citizenship, and desire Jewish spouses.The rigor of the author -- interviews with 84 individuals in 1984 and reinterviewing in 1994 -- is praiseworthy. Although she apparently tried to elicit controversial subjects, again and again the interviewees return to issues from their daily life. Thus, instead of a problematic, dangerous, and diseased society in which neo-Nazis run amok or Germans humiliate their Jewish neighbors, we see a sanguine picture of normality. We are introduced to very nice people facing the uneventful problems of living as a national minority in a very rich but ethnically homogenized land. Furthermore, this book seems to show that the denazification of West Germany (the interviewees are from Frankfurt) enjoyed success; most of the stories about German colleagues and friends reflect positive values -- condemnation of German aggression, guilt for the Holocaust, and a healthy tolerance of Jews. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 1999}, {\"paperId\": \"88ba24f0a746ea355c6d4581c79dc1c5c004b30a\", \"title\": \"\\\\u201cAnd the Ones that Survived had Hope\\\\u201d: Resilience in Holocaust Survivors\", \"abstract\": \"The current study uses a strengths-based lens to explore the resilience narratives of five Holocaust survivors and their perspectives on experiences of resilience during and after the Holocaust.

Drawing inspiration and ideas from the works of psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl, Dr. Breitbart and his fellow, Dr. Mindy Greenstein, designed an 8-week, group-focused, manualized course of experiential exercises, which is being compared to an 8-week, manualized cancer support group intervention, to see how well meaning-focused care can address a constellation of constructs that he and his colleagues are calling \\\\u201cdespair at the end of life.\\\\u201d The component constructs of despair at the end of life include hopelessness, depression, loss of meaning, suicidal ideation, and desire for hastened death.

This relevancy consists in the fact that the idea of identity involves a continuous \\\\u201crapport \\\\u00e0 soi\\\\u201d that unfolds two main characteristics of one\\\\u2019s identity: on the one hand, reflexivity, a certain disclosure of an image of one\\\\u2019s self, and on the other hand, an endless search of a peculiar, always new and differentiated system of values. Employing these principles in his discussions with Nicolae Kall\\\\u00f3s, now a consultant professor and a PhD. supervisor at the Babeo-Bolyai University from Cluj and the author, among others, of books like: The Political Consciousness (1968), Sociology, Politics, Ideology (1975), and Politics as science (1975), Frunz\\\\u00e3 has succeeded in vividly portraying the conducive principle of the life of the intellectual Nicolae Kall\\\\u00f3s, who has experienced Holocaust, communism, and transition to a democratic society.

Compared to a more scientific statistical approach, any approach of Oral History could be easily accused of being subjective and of not having objective relevance to an entire community. After reading such a book, which reveals historic truth through the raw example of a life experience, one comes to believe that the words of a survivor of the Nazi concentration camps are emblematic at least of the community from which he came from. A central idea consistently discussed in the interview is that of the relation between belief and Jewishness.

Together and Apart in Brzezany: Poles, Jews, and Ukrainians, 1919-1945. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2002. xix, 202 pp. Maps. Illustrations. Notes. Bibliography. Index. Cloth.Before the second World War Brzezany, then in eastern Poland now in western Ukraine, resembled many medium-sized towns in the region. Poles and Jews made up nearly eighty percent of the total population but the surrounding countryside was predominantly Ukrainian, and Ukrainians increasingly migrated into the town. The newly-resurrected Poland of the interwar period favored ethnic Poles but also allowed its non-Polish citizens-around a third of the total population-a certain degree of cultural and autonomy. During this period, however, xenophobic and antisemitic streams within the Polish population and government gained strength. Such is the background of Shimon Redlich\\'s memorable account-part history and part memoir-of interethnic relations in Brzezany between the two world wars.As Redlich makes clear from the start, this book differs radically in scope and approach from his previous works. Historians will know Redlich\\'s respected work on the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee in the USSR during World War II. The book under review, however, is a much more personal document. Redlich was born in Brzezany in 1935 and begins the book with an account of his return to the now Ukrainian town of Berezhany in 1991. Throughout, personal memories and interviews with survivors-Polish, Ukrainian, and Jewish-from that period are interspersed with more impersonal-some would say \\\\\"objective\\\\\"-historical data, creating a unique and compelling narrative of that time and place. Redlich, who recalls \\\\\"growing up in Polish,\\\\\" survived the Holocaust with help from Ukrainians, and has now lived a half-century in Israel, is perhaps uniquely capable of appreciating and reporting dispassionately the different attitudes and behaviors of the three ethnic groups of his native town. Unlike some of his interviewees who remark, for example, that all Poles were antisemites, Redlich manages to portray both vivid individual portraits and plausible reconstructions of events, including the most terrible ones. Obviously a work that touches on issues of mass murder cannot avoid moral questions, nor does Redlich pretend to be an \\\\\"objective observer\\\\\" at all moments. But he retains throughout a higher kind of objectivity, one which allows him to discuss motivations-even unsavory ones-with nuance, and appreciation for both positive and negative aspects of human behavior, all the while avoiding cheap moralizing or ethnic stereotyping. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2002}, {\"paperId\": \"8b647ab3b9e4ce58420b63f8ad4d037d231e5688\", \"title\": \"The Unsaid, the Incommunicable, the Unbearable, and the Irretrievable\", \"abstract\": \"Abstract Drawing on forty years of interviewing Holocaust survivors\\\\u2014in most cases, multiple interviews with the same survivors over months, years, even decades\\\\u2014this article elucidates the range and complexity of different kinds of silence in survivors\\\\u2019 spoken accounts.

When you were growing up, what films about Jewish life or the Holocaust had an impact on you? LT: I do not remember having seen a film about Jewish life or the Holocaust made by a German filmmaker when I was young. I think the first one I ever saw was The Sound of Music. I was about six years old and remember a nice and happy film that suddenly switched to the scene when the family has to flee across the mountains to evade being captured by the Nazis. It was very scary. The first film about Jewish life that I saw was Hester Street by Joan Micklin-Silver. I remember seeing it in Munich with my family and other people from the Jewish community. Everybody was very moved and proud that there was a film about \\\\\"us.\\\\\" There were only 5,000 Jews in Munich out of a total population of 1.5 million. Everyone knew each other. I was confronted with the issue of the Holocaust through books rather than films. My parents gave me The Diary of Anne Frank and the books of Leon Uris. I saw the movie versions of The Diary and Exodus after I had read the books. I saw a stage production of Fiddler on the Roof before I watched the film. LB: I noticed that one of your first films was about Aktionsuhnenzeichen, a group of young Germans who undertake various projects to help the victims of Nazi Germany. What attracted you to this topic? LT: This documentary was my first work for Israeli TV. I did not speak Hebrew yet, but the head of the program Mabat Sheni, Michael Karpin, wanted me to do a film on this topic. I filmed young Germans working in Israel, trying to cope with the German past by helping Jews and Arabs there. LB: You are now studying in Israel. Have you made Aliyah or do you plan to return to Germany to make films about Jewish subjects? LT: I made Aliyah years ago. I make films both in Germany and Israel. This is a small world, you know. Of course, Rosenzweig\\'s Freedom was shot and produced in Germany. I am now planning a feature film called H.O.M.E. that will be set in Jerusalem in 2000. It will be done in English.

The premise of the research \\\\u2013 that there are meanings outside of the photographic frame \\\\u2013 follows notions of \\\\u2013 Barthes\\\\u2019 \\\\u2018punctum\\\\u2019 (Barthes, 1982), Hirsch\\\\u2019s \\\\u2018postmemory-work\\\\u2019 (Hirsch, 2012) and Langford\\\\u2019s \\\\u2018oral-photographic framework\\\\u2019 (Langford, 2008). I use the term confabulation to nominate the combination of two significant aspects of storytelling: the act of \\\\u2018going beyond the photographic frame\\\\u2019 and the act of filling in missing narrative-memory gaps with new meanings. My hypothesis is that confabulation, through conversation around photographs, gains access to the performative-interactive-register of family photographs; it reveals shadow archives and catalyses their content, that act as counter-memory. The research also engages with Vilem Flusser\\\\u2019s theory (Flusser, 2000), suggesting that confabulated counter-narratives are tools, which work against the programme of the photographic apparatus. The research asks how does confabulation, through affecting reading and editing, excavate the private content of family photographs from shadow-archives and transform it to counter-memories? \\\\n \\\\nIn 1945 the Soviet army liberated Hungary and stopped the Nazi deportations and executions; simultaneously the communist regime socialised properties and kept citizens under control by the Secret Police. Deportation and murder continued, leading to further ruptures in the socio-cultural environment, which divided national-cultural memory. The 20th century Hungarian historical context is a fertile ground for case studies, as all ethnicities of the population suffered significant trauma. Due to state-directed forced remembering and forgetting, losses stayed unprocessed. These \\\\nmaintain their presence, dominate private memories through generations in forms of resurfacing traumas or active silencing \\\\u2013 manifesting as gaps. \\\\n \\\\nIn the research, I adopt two positions to capture confabulation; the autoethnographic and the archivist-editor. \\\\n \\\\nIn my personal, autoethnographic inquiry, I question the intentions behind my family\\\\u2019s silenced narratives of both Holocaust survivor and communist perpetrator pasts. The process of excavation includes facing limitations, which I aim to translate. From the material re-enactment, I learn that erasure is a perpetual, un-achievable, act. The visual outputs encrypt such experiences. The pocket-sized books enable the viewers for an active, performed engagement through which they simultaneously experience the obsessive attempts of filling in the gaps to reconstruct \\\\u2013 moving the objects to peek into holes \\\\u2013 and failure through material resistance. \\\\n \\\\nThrough the archivist-editor practice I foreground other people\\\\u2019s subjectivity. To collect confabulated stories on photographs, I combined oral history methods, open-ended insider interviews with autoethnographical methods of \\\\u2018collaborative witness\\\\u2019 (Ellis, Rawicki, 2013) and \\\\u2018friendship as method\\\\u2019 (Tillmann-Healy, 2003). From such an internal position, I accompany the eight participants \\\\u2013 my friends \\\\u2013 in their idiosyncratic meaning making, where I performed as the audience for the storyteller. Through insider participation, I analysed our interaction, mapped and visualised our encounter, expanding Langford\\\\u2019s\\\\u2019 oral-photographic framework, creating family album-like photobooks in both digital and material form. Moving to the collective level, I also mapped and visualised how Hungarian ideological frameworks weave into the participants\\\\u2019 personal network and how do these correspond with each other as memory texts (Kuhn, 2002). This methodology revealed that confabulated narratives deviate from the participant\\\\u2019s pre-set narrative frameworks. \\\\n \\\\nI argue that the oral-performative-interactive register of photographs is accessible through confabulation. The viewer, interacting with the listener, transforms into a storyteller, draws the emotional narrative around the gaps \\\\u2013 the denied and silences past \\\\u2013 which creates a presence for it \\\\u2013 that eventually can be recovered and reconciled.

Mening, minne, kompromettering\", \"abstract\": \"This thesis examines the representation in visual culture of the Holocaust, the Nazi genocide of European Jewry. It is divided into three main parts, each one focusing on a particular aspect of Holocaust representation. Part 1, \\\\\"Meaning\\\\\" (chapter 1-3), begins by considering the important role played by documentary photographs from the concentration camps for the public knowledge and conception of the Holocaust. The thesis then proceeds to study the work and reception of five artists, between 1945 and 1998, who have used these atrocity photos as a basis for their art: Corrado Cagli, Gerhart Frankl, Rico Lebrun, Boris Lurie and Robert Morris. In some of them, the motive of the mass grave is found to take on new cultural meanings through the passage from documentary- to artistic image. In others, the atrocity imagery instead undermines the conventions of meaning in art. The author proposes the theory of abject and abjection, by the French-Rumanian psychoanalyst Julia Kristeva, as an interpretational model of these negotiations between the motif of the mass grave and visual culture.\\\\n\\\\nPart 2,\\\\\"Memory\\\\\" (chapter 4-5), first considers the visualisation of Holocaust memory in the forms of video interviews with Holocaust survivors, Holocaust monuments (Buchenwald and Berlin), and photographs of Jewish life before and during the Holocaust. These are analysed with regard to different understandings of Holocaust memory as either \\\\\"traumatic\\\\\" or \\\\\"constructed\\\\\", borrowed from historiography. The thesis then proceeds to examine Holocaust memory in digital media, such as the Internet and CD-rom, in which the technology seems to foster ideas about memory as programmable and re-programmable. The author detects a shift from \\\\\"historical\\\\\" to \\\\\"virtual\\\\\" Holocaust memory, when the interactive features of digital media are combined with a pedagogy that stresses empathetic insight and identification. Clashes between competing collective memories over official Holocaust monuments are contrasted to the simultaneous individualisation and universalisation of Holocaust memory in the new media.\\\\n\\\\nPart 3, \\\\\"Incrimination\\\\\" (chapter 6-8), examines the visual representation of Nazism and forms an antipole to the focus on processes of meaning and identification in the previous parts of the book. \\\\\"Incrimination\\\\\" is here understood as a kind of cultural, negative signification of a secondary order, a \\\\\"counter-meaning\\\\\" always consisting of the destruction of a pre-existing positive meaning or identity. From this perspective, the author discusses various forms of the visualisation of Nazism, including some adopted by the Nazi regime itself as well as today\\\\u2019s post-modern appropriations of the aesthetics and iconography of Nazism. From the conflict within Nazism over German Expressionism to the censoring of contemporary artists like Melvin Charney, Zbigniew Libera and Ronald Jones from international exhibitions, this study points to the problems involved in visually defining Nazism and its ties to both European cultural traditions and to modernity.\", \"year\": 2002}, {\"paperId\": \"92ba579aa87d2419dc3d3b8835e87018ba21b85b\", \"title\": \"Forty years later: long-term consequences of massive traumatization as manifested by Holocaust survivors from the city and the Kibbutz.\", \"abstract\": \"The present study explored the differences between male and female Holocaust survivors (n = 34) and controls (n = 34) who were similar to the survivors but had not been victims of the Holocaust.

Survivors were worse off psychologically than comparison individuals on the quality of emotional life, on emotional expression, and on the quality of interpersonal relations. Also, survivors assigned relatively greater value to their postwar families.

One of those interviewed, Adnan Abbas, recounted that he had been asked: \\\\u201c\\\\u2018Hasn\\\\u2019t Iraq had enough war, enough bad things? Why not make something bright?\\\\u2019\\\\u201d His response was appropriate: \\\\u201c\\\\u2018Misery is part of humanity, especially here. How can anyone miss that?\\\\u2019\\\\u201d The New York Times story was not about genocide, but the ugly consequences of war and the need for artists to depict and witness by painting in less than ideal conditions. This response is nothing new, although the plastic arts when connected to genocide, except for art created during the Holocaust, have had a low profile. The reasons for this are imprecise. Certainly, however, many writers and scholars feel ill-equipped to deal with the subject and are content to deal with the photographic and film/video records, which have their own power and what might be termed \\\\u201cauthenticity.\\\\u201d Until the age of computer manipulation, it was thought that the camera lens did not lie. Now, however, we are not so certain. Thus, it seems logical to think about how the artistic vision has given us an impression of atrocities and genocidal events. Atrocity has been depicted often in the visual arts over the past centuries. There is an impressive record of such work, from the Disasters of War series by the Spanish artist Goya to Picasso\\\\u2019s Guernica, to recent art dealing with politically charged subjects. More important is what art about genocide looks like and how should it be used. The images may not be so obvious. For those who have familiarity with the wealth of artistic resources that emerged from the Holocaust, the material base for other genocides may seem paltry. The artistic legacy can come from many quarters: outsiders warning about genocide or massacres in posters; images by survivors which include children\\\\u2019s art done after the end of genocide; imaginative and what may be called \\\\u201cpost-modern\\\\u201d art made under the worst circumstances, such as during the siege of Sarajevo, in order to convey a specific message about art and artists trying to send a message to the Journal of Genocide Research (2005), 7(1), March, 31\\\\u201346\", \"year\": 2005}, {\"paperId\": \"933631150978944a582bff5a1f2d7e129931805c\", \"title\": \"The Unrighteous Righteous and the Righteous Unrighteous\", \"abstract\": \"This analysis of several hundred accounts by Jewish survivors of the Holocaust in Poland and by Poles who helped them survive offers a nuanced picture of Jewish-Polish relations during and after World War II.

Renov\\'s essay is also an occasion to compare the practices of film and video production in works that look to the same contested geographical region. I propose to direct Renov\\'s thinking toward Ravctt/s more recent film, The March (1999), which invites comparison with Lebanese-Canadian video artist Jayce Salloum\\'s video unfilled part I: everything and nothing (1999/2002). Each work features a woman witness, and each presents us with material for an archive of documents on the Middle East. In The March Ravelt edits together footage of his mother shot over a number of years using syne-sound filmmaking equipment. He makes the same request of her every lime he shoots, namely that she relate her experience of a march under the watch of Nazi soldiers. In untitled part I: everything and nothing, Salloum shoots a single-take interview on video with Soha Bechara, a young-woman who has recently been released from an Israeli detention center. The video is edited down to forty minutes and the subject\\'s statements translated into English subtitles. Each work takes an experimental approach to documentary by approaching the record of testimony with some caution. Before I take up die works at issue in this essay, I want to make a few observations about Ravett\\'s film on his father that drew Renov\\'s attention. Here we can initiate reflection on the concept of a witness. In the film, the filmmaker\\'s own relationship with his wife and children provokes him to ask questions of his father about a wife and children his father lost during the Holocaust. Everything \\'v For You stages familial encounters that invite comparison with the biblical and Talmudic story of the binding of Isaac. For example, the filmmaker shares his first name with the Jewish patriarch who attempted to fulfill God\\'s command lo sacrifice his son Isaac on Mount Moriah. This story has fueled extensive philosophical reflection on responsibility, most notably by French philosopher Jacques Derrida in The Gift of Death (1095). For Derrida, responsibility is a matter of responding to the Other within the religions of the book (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), all of which share the figure of Abraham/Ibrahim. In the biblical story Abraham answers God\\'s call but can only accept responsibility by acting irresponsibly before mankind. \\\\\"He acts as if he were discharged of his duty toward his fellows, his son. and humankind.\\\\\" Derrida writes, \\\\\"but he continues to love them. He must love them,.. and also owe them everything in order to sacrifice them (2) For Derrida the paradox of loving those toward which one is acting in an immoral manner cannot bo remedied. It makes no sense to bring Abraham before a human tribunal. because the call is precisely to respond to a command to behave in a reprehensible way. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] How is all of this related to the concept of a witness? Abraham feels himself absolved of his duty before men and does not attempt to explain himself or tell his secret. This secrecy, Derrida suggests, belongs to the experience of the witness. Abraham is a witness to \\\\\"an absolute relation with the absolute, but he doesn\\'t witness to it in the sense that to witness means to show, teach, illustrate, [or] manifest to others the truth that one can precisely attest to.\\\\\" (3) This particular concept of the witness, however, does not adequately give us the sense in which Ravett\\'.s mother, Fela, might be a witness in The March not only because she is a woman, but because the question she is repeatedly asked over the course of the years the film spans concerns a death march endured as an individual rather than the sacrifice of a familv member. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2012}, {\"paperId\": \"946716adcb0c5aef3c658d1d4a87b71e93b56483\", \"title\": \"The transmutation of testimony in Cling, Najman and Finkiel\\'s Aftermath films\", \"abstract\": \"Abstract During this last decade a large number of testimonial films, dedicated to the survivors of the Shoah, have been prompted by the same urge: the revisionist and negationist schemes regarding the Holocaust and the vulnerable state of the aging eyewitness.

MISSION. AND LEGACY. BY DR NATAN OPHIR (OFFENBACHER), JERUSALEM, ISRAEL: URIM PUBLICATIONS, 2014. 504 PP.It has been more than 20 years since the passing of Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach. Since then, many volumes have been published which feature collections of Reb Shlomo\\'s inspirational stories, commentary on the Torah, etc. Dr. Natan Ophir\\'s ambitious biography of Carlebach is the first attempt to present the story of Carlebach rather than the stories. As Dr. Ophir puts forth in the preface, his goal is \\\\\"to compose what is called a \\'critical biography.\\' As opposed to subjective and interpretive biographies, this genre entails meticulous research, detailed footnotes, and scholarly annotations in order to piece together dates, names, and places. The aim is to evaluate the life of the subject by setting forth minutiae that become meaningful through the prism of the historical backdrop and the colorfulness of the cultural settings\\\\\" (13). Having said that, Ophir soon admits his own personal connection to Carlebach and the struggle he encountered to be objective in his writing.To understand Shlomo Carlebach\\'s development and impact, it is necessary to examine the cultural shifts which were taking place during the second half of the 20Ih century in both secular and Jewish circles. Ophir does an admirable job of describing the changing face of Jewish youth in America; the many disenfranchised children of holocaust survivors who were searching for meaning that they were unable to find in Judaism. Through personal interviews, Ophir chronicles many stories of Jewish youth who were seeking for answers in Middle Eastern religions and who were brought back to Judaism by Carlebach\\'s warmth, unconditional love and acceptance, and version of Jewish practice and ritual. Ophir also brielfy profiles Yogi Bhajan, Sufi Sam, and Swami Satchidananda, three gurus with whom Carlebach was \\'competing\\' for the Jewish souls. Perhaps Carlebach\\'s message was most realized in the formation of his \\'House of Love and Prayer\\' in San Francisco in the late sixties and early seventies where the \\'holy beggars\\' found a place to rediscover their roots.Ophir divides the book into independent sections with self contained chronologies. For instance, chapter eight discusses Carlebach\\'s relationship with Israel between 1959-1994, while chapter nine discusses his work on behalf of Soviet Jewry and his travels to Eastern Europe and Russia between the years 1965-1989. The isolation of topics makes them more convenient to understand individually. However, the overlapping timeline caused me to flip back to previous chapters to understand the events in a broader biographical perspective.Ophir\\'s narrative is enhanced by first person accounts by people who, over a fifty year period, interacted with and were inspired by Carlebach. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2015}, {\"paperId\": \"94d48ab72d038a41fdb5c68baf052500c5898b58\", \"title\": \"Imagined witness : representing the Holocaust in American women\\'s fiction\", \"abstract\": \"This thesis explores representations of the Holocaust in fiction by American women writers who have no autobiographical involvement with the Holocaust. It demonstrates that their texts comprise fictional meditations on the meaning of testimony, and are concerned with the ways in which narrators and readers of testimonies remember and imagine the Holocaust. The introduction outlines the key thematic, formal and theoretical concerns of the thesis within their academic context. It proposes that a self-reflexive awareness of the subjectivity and constructedness of Holocaust representation in fiction provides insight into valuable and necessary processes of the imagination. Four chapters examine different approaches to the imagination. The first interprets Norma Rosen\\'s Touching Evil through her notion of witness-through-the-imagination. Drawing on concepts such as empathy, identification, secondary trauma and the addressee, it explores the meaning of Holocaust testimony for the reader. The second considers the subjectivity of memory by comparing the testimonies and memories of the traumatised survivor protagonists in the historical novels of Susan Fromberg Schaeffer\\'s Anya and Sherri Szeman\\'s The Kommandant\\'s Mistress. The third chapter analyses the imagination as an alternative reality for mourning the past in Cynthia Ozick\\'s The Shawl. It also engages with the dialectic between personal and collective memory through notions of ethnic uprootedness and assimilation. The fourth addresses the fantastical imagination of the Holocaust in the fiction of Judy Budnitz through her use of various literary genres and complex narratological and metafictional devices that draw attention to the acts of storytelling and witnessing. In conclusion, the thesis shows that this body of Holocaust texts examines fiction as a meaningful tool to bridge and to draw attention to the gaps between experience and representation. It broadens the implications of bearing witness due to their discourses about the significant mediation of imaginary realities.

Many members of staff in the School of English at the University of Newcastle have encouraged, supported and advised me. Without funding from the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and a scholarship from the Faculty of Arts at the University of Newcastle, this thesis would not have been written. Further conference grants from the Department of English and a travel award from the British Association for American Studies made a valuable trip to Pittsburgh and Ohio possible, where I was able to give a paper on the first chapter and interviewed Sherri Szeman, whom I thank for her generous hospitality. A research contract with the Stichting Auschwitz in Brussels allowed me to expand my research on the third chapter, which resulted in a publication in their journal. Academic support from the University of Ghent has been invaluable: Prof. Buelens, Prof. Versluys and Bart Lievens have constantly provided advice and criticism when it was most needed. S. Lillian Kremer kindly gave me feedback and research material for chapter two. Many friends at Newcastle deserve a special mention: thanks to Dr. Manta le VaulGrimwood for her constructive advice, Dr. Allyna Ward for her unconditional friendship, Katharine Griffiths for her motivation, Tracy Olverson for constantly challenging me, and Paul Crosthwaite for his inspiring remarks. Gwyneth Bodger livened up discussions at numerous conferences, and Chris Kiel shared humorous and critical observations. My parents, grandparents, brother Bert and Melina have encouraged me from the beginning, as have numerous friends: Cat, Nathalie, Christine, Petey, Louise, Stefanie, Jelske, and Cecilia.

Immediately after the end of World War II in 1945, German contemporary historians made great efforts to document and clarify the period of the Third Reich, but they did so without contemporary witnesses, because for them oral interviews were not as valuable as written historical sources. It was only in the 1970s that oral history was \\\\u2018imported\\\\u2019 to (West) Germany by a prominent contemporary historian, Lutz Niethammer. He and his colleagues, Alexander von Plato among them, established oral history as a viable research tool in German historiography by carrying out several major oral history projects on the working classes in Ruhr region and in East Germany before reunification. They pointed out that oral history was a powerful tool for understanding people\\\\u2019s experiences,a notion which had not been widely accepted in German academic history. Oral history also played an important role in communication between workers and historians in the 1980s. Recently, many oral history projects have focused on \\\\u2018victims of history\\\\u2019, such as those who had been oppressed by the Nazis, Holocaust survivors, forced labourers, etc., where emphasis is placed on memory.

Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2009 (xiv + 254) pb. US$21.95. ISBN 978-0-8047-5632-7. In the decade 1993-2003 Wittner published a trilogy of scholarly volumes on the history of the international anti-nuclear weapons movement, which arguably grew into the largest grassroots movement of all time. The three tomes, which collectively covered almost 1800 pages and thousands of footnotes, began with the prophetic warning in H.G. Wells\\' novel The World Set Free, published in 1914, about a fictitious war fought with \\'atomic bombs.\\' The outcome of this war was devastating, but Wells\\' book had an upbeat ending. To avert an even greater catastrophe the survivors rallied to create a world government and save humanity. The modern story that Wittner chronicles over 90 years does not quite emulate the novel. Humans still have a long way to go before establishing a world government, but some progress is being made. Despite calamitous outbursts of religious, ethnic and power motivated killings, a process of globalisation is gradually moving homo sapiens in the direction of a world community. Moreover, as in the Wells plot, after witnessing the disasters of two relatively localised atomic attacks, humans have managed thus far to escape the horrors of a nuclear holocaust. How the \\'great escape\\' eventuated is the story that unfolds in the scholarly trilogy, and is now encapsulated in a slimmer and single work aimed not only at academia but also concerned members of the general public. In the condensed version under review, Wittner sets out at the very beginning the major question that his well researched and highly readable narrative addresses. Since nations are inclined to use the weapons that they develop, how is it that nuclear war has been avoided since 1945? Moreover, only nine nations possess nuclear arsenals, while 186 for diverse reasons possess none. Those that have acquired \\'the bomb\\' have entered into some restraining measures that indicate they are very much aware of the special dangers attached to nuclear weapons: for instance, the Partial Test Ban Treaty; Strategic Arms Limitation Treaties (SALT); Strategic Arms Reduction Treaties (START); Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT); and Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). The prevailing rationale attributes the nuclear restraint to the deterrence power of nuclear weapons. But if that is the case, why the motivation to enter into arms control and disarmament agreements? Why have the nuclear powers refrained from waging nuclear war against the unarmed nuclear nations, sometimes at the cost of losing a war? Wittner\\'s book uncovers an answer that is not part of the conventional wisdom, even in some sections of the peace movement. He concludes \\'that the missing ingrethent is a massive nuclear disarmament movement- hone that has mobilised millions of people in nations around the globe, and, thereby, saved the world from nuclear war\\' (xii). Admittedly that mobilisation has been uneven globally and has waxed and waned over the decades, but in terms of the nuclear threat levels the movement has responded by mobilising gigantic numbers of ordinary people as well as the key institutions of civil society. The evidence that Wittner presents in support of this assertion is overwhelming. He has extensively inspected the files of disarmament organisations, and has had access to formerly secret government records. He has interviewed countless anti-nuclear activists and government officials, and he has perused numerous memoirs, periodicals and other published materials. The details of this extensive research are laid out in the trilogy (each book of which had previously been reviewed in Social Alternatives). In Confronting the Bomb the reader receives mainly the argument and narrative. Nevertheless, he does spell out a most critical point: namely, that most government off icials were not favorably disposed to nuclear arms control and disarmament measures. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2009}, {\"paperId\": \"99cdb4df8f153d9fdbe872afbd4ff9fa0c55d3f8\", \"title\": \"The National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder INTERNATIONAL HANDBOOK OF MULTIGENERATIONAL LEGACIES OF TRAUMA\", \"abstract\": \"INTERNATIONAL HANDBOOK OF MULTIGENERATIONAL LEGACIES OF TRAUMA Yael Danieli, PhD Group Project for Holocaust Survivors and Their Children New York, NY This is the first book on traumatic stress that examines multigenerational effects of trauma across various victim/survivor populations around the world from multidimensional and multidisciplinary perspectives. Its structure follows the developmen\\\\u00ad tal foci of this field. Following a contextual intro\\\\u00ad duction, the book is divided into eleven sections that span the decades from World War II to the present, covering the intergenerational effects of genocide, the fall of communism and the aftermath of repressive regimes, crime and urban violence, and the plight of indigenous peoples. There are chapters on infectious and life-threatening diseases as well as the biology of intergenerational trauma; the final chapter attempts to synthesize those pre\\\\u00ad ceding it. A brief overview introduces each section. Part I consists of five chapters that explore the nature and prevalence of multigenerational effects of the Nazi Holocaust on its victims and perpetra\\\\u00ad tors from theoretical, clinical, and empirical view\\\\u00ad points. Auerhahn and Laub, using case examples, delineate 10 forms of intergenerational knowing (remembering) trauma, modes of transmission, and implications for prevention and healing. Felsen re\\\\u00ad views non-clinical controlled studies done in North America up to 1996, addresses the discrepancies between clinical and empirical reports, and pro\\\\u00ad poses a unifying conceptual framework for various findings. Solomon reviews and classifies all pub\\\\u00ad lished empirical studies carried out on the \\\\u201csecond generation\\\\u201d in Israel up to 1995. Focusing on grand\\\\u00ad children of Nazis, Hardtmann describes psycho\\\\u00ad analytically parents\\\\u2019 use of denial, splitting, projec\\\\u00ad tion, and projective identifications to defend against, yet transmit to them, their past, and suggests treat\\\\u00ad ment recommendations and further exploration. Bar-on and collaborators describe seminars for Ger\\\\u00ad man and Israeli youth struggling to work through their personal and collective identities as they con\\\\u00ad front the Holocaust and each other. Part II has six chapters that report on family and intergenerational sequelae of WWII. Bernstein touches upon intergenerational implications of con\\\\u00ad flicts in adjustment in American prisoners of war, while Nagata, using a national survey and in-depth interviews, reports multiple effects of the JapaneseAmerican internment upon the third-generation (Sansei) children of internees. From Japan, focusing on Hibakusha Nisei (children of atomic bomb survi\\\\u00ad vors), Tatara illustrates the importance of the physi\\\\u00ad ological, political, socioeconomic, cultural, and so\\\\u00ad cial dimensions to understanding their intergen\\\\u00ad erational trauma. Three chapters describe groups of Dutch \\\\u201cchildren of the war.\\\\u201d Op den Velde reports on the diverse problems and specific family (psycho)dynamics of children of war-sailors and civilian Resistance veterans, while Lindt describes the recently-begun process of integration from their outcast status for the children of collaborators. Aarts discusses clinical and empirical findings of intergenerational effects in families of WWII survi\\\\u00ad vors from the Dutch East Indies. Part III contains two chapters describing the ef\\\\u00ad fects of genocide and migration on survivors, their cultures, and their families: Kupelian and colleagues studied the impact of Turkish persecution and geno\\\\u00ad cide of the Armenians on their ethnic identity, psy\\\\u00ad chopathology, and meaning in the second and third generations; Kinzie et al. describe effects of the Cambodian genocide on its survivors, their fami\\\\u00ad lies, their parenting abilities, and their children. Part IV includes three chapters addressing as\\\\u00ad pects of intergenerational transmission of the effects of the Vietnam War. Empirically comparing Viet\\\\u00ad nam veterans whose fathers served in combat with those who did not, Rosenheck and Fontana con\\\\u00ad cluded that intergenerational effects of trauma emerge when the second generation itself has PTSD, and are more related to intergenerational processes during the homecoming period than to differences in pre-military vulnerability. Hunter-King\\\\u2019s survey of children of service personnel missing in action indicates the mother\\\\u2019s critical role in determining their coping, and the preventive value of adequate support to the families. Ancharoff and collaborators examine several mechanisms of transmission, inter\\\\u00ad ventions, and clinical implications. Part V includes three chapters examining intergenerational effects revealed after the fall of com\\\\u00ad munism, central to which are issues of submerged ethnic identity.

Survivors living in the United States, and particularly those living in Israel, portray better family life and social and psychological outcomes.

Research shows there is a link between the parents\\' trauma and a variety of psychological symptoms in children of survivors. Children of Nazis have also been a topic of psychological and journalistic inquiry. The research suggests that many of these children experience conflict, shame, and personal guilt when dealing with their parents\\' Nazi past. The much discussed \\\\\"inability to mourn\\\\\" has been identified as the central reason for why these children were traumatized. These findings have been central to our awareness of the intergen-erational effects of the Holocaust. There is to date, however, no systematic research that compares the effects on these two groups of descendants. Thus, in an effort to advance research in this area, this study was undertaken to explore similarities between these two groups. Whereas previous studies have focused on the pathological effects of trauma on each group separately, the focus of this study was on comparative coping responses of individuals whose parents were involved in an extreme social injustice. An additional later aim is to study the interpersonal behavior between children of survivors and children of Nazis. The study consisted of interviewing 20 subjects, 10 children of Nazis and 10 children of concentration camp survivors. The former subjects were interviewed by a child of a Nazi (Kuphal), and the latter were interviewed by a child of concentration camp survivors (Weissmark). The interview was de-signed by a neutral party (Giacomo) to generate data by focusing on broad areas. The investigators hypothesized that these areas would yield useful data for comparing the similarities and differences between the two groups of sub-jects. Responses of children of survivors and Nazis revealed similar threads of images and associations to the past that run through their lives.

Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007. 391 pp. $21.95. The Holocaust units I created for my middle school students always included stories of survivors. From time to time we were fortunate enough to have a survivor visit the school for a personal talk. This was in the 90s, when more and more survivor stories were being collected, published, and made available to public school teachers. From these stories, a paradigmatic survivor emerged, one who had been liberated from one of the many camps, one who had somehow managed to defy death only to find that most if not all of her/his family members had been exterminated. As Holocaust scholarship continues into the 21st century, scholars are examining more closely other kinds of survivor stories - stories that challenge traditional notions of survival. In Beyond Anne Frank: Hidden Children and Postwar Families in Holland, sociologist Diane Wolf takes the reader on a disturbing journey into the world of hidden children. The book is based on over seventy interviews conducted between 1998 and 2001 with adults who were hidden as children in Holland. Wolf contends that only by examining both wartime and postwar contexts will we begin to understand the full effects of the Shoah. She uses a \\\\\"sociological lens\\\\\" to study these \\\\\"other\\\\\" survivors and their childhood memories, with the emphasis on what occurred in the days and years after the war as they dealt with their own war experiences as well as those of their parents and caregivers. While liberation meant one thing to those who survived the horrors of the camps, for hidden children liberation often ushered in yet another ordeal. As Wolf\\'s title suggests, the now ubiquitous story of Anne Frank, however powerful and enlightening, does not represent the experiences of most child survivors from the Netherlands. Beyond Anne Frank begins with a critical history of the ways in which survivor stories, and in particular the role of child survivor stories, contribute to our present understanding of the Holocaust. Wolf points out that most of the scholarly work examining the experiences of hidden children in the Netherlands focuses on Jewish orphans, bringing to light the activities of the Dutch Guardian Commission for War Foster Children (OPK) which made decisions about where and with whom Jewish orphans would be housed. Wolf offers a concise look into the relationship between the Dutch government and its Jews during the period 1940-45; unlike the popular image of the Dutch tolerance suggested by Anne Frank\\'s story, the most recent literature suggests that Dutch citizens were far more apathetic, even to the point of allowing the Nazis to deport and murder their own citizens. Only recently has the Dutch government, which for many years perpetuated the myth that the government acted in the best interests of its Jewish citizens, finally acknowledged its negligence. The chapters that present the actual stories of hidden children form the heart and soul of Beyond Anne Frank. Although Wolf documents their experiences in hiding, she found that the most common refrain from hidden children was \\\\\"my war began after the war.\\\\\" The interviews are a powerful demonstration of how the Holocaust continued - and continues - to affect the lives and families of survivors. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2008}, {\"paperId\": \"9fe33423ac81c51e1eeae93e4dae0b3949c89f12\", \"title\": \"Exploring the Educational Potential of a Video-Interview with a Shoah Survivor\", \"abstract\": \"This article aims to establish what the education potential is of video-interviews with Shoah survivors that have been made available as historical sources for learners in secondary schools.

The reservation (approximately 1,100 Spokane Tribal members live there), where the effects of what Alexie chooses to call an \\\\\"on-going colonialism\\\\\" still asserts its painful presence, is central in Alexie\\'s fiction, The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven (1993) and Reservation Blues (1995). Presented as a demarcated space of suffering, Alexie\\'s fictional reservation is a place where his characters are tormented by collective memories of a genocidal past, of cavalry-approved hangings, massacres, and small-pox-infected blankets. It is a haunted place where \\\\\"faint voices ... echo[] all over\\\\\" (Reservation Blues 46) and where \\\\\"dreams ... [a]re murdered ... the bones buried quickly just inches below the surface, all waiting to break through the foundations of those government houses built by the Department of Housing and Urban Development\\\\\" (Reservation Blues 7). Although some of Alexie\\'s characters leave the reservation and enter the urban space in his second novel, Indian Killer (1996), the experience of growing up, as Alexie puts it in the interview, \\\\\"firmly within borders,\\\\\" continues to affect the characters\\' lives, especially their emotional lives. Inevitably when dealing with ethnic literature, it is impossible not to be self-conscious of one\\'s own position. As a European white female scholar, I felt compelled to raise questions of perspective, including those of nationality, ethnicity, and gender. Within this context of self-reflection, the interview touches upon issues such as the desire for a \\\\\"pure\\\\\" or authentic American Indian identity and the critical demand for the genre \\\\\"American Indian literature.\\\\\" One of the most intriguing aspects of Alexie\\'s fiction is his use of the comic. Although the subject matters in Alexie\\'s fiction are morally and ethically engaging, the same texts are often ironic, satiric, and full of humor. As the characters in a caricature-like manner stagger across the reservation, between drinking the next beer and cracking the next joke, the reader is often invited to laugh along with them, even at them. Alexie\\'s artistic vision thus mixes humor and suffering in a manner that for me resembles what Roberto Benigni does in his film Life is Beautiful or Art Spiegelman in his graphic novels, Maus: A Survivor\\'s Tale. Such a comparison becomes all the more justified in the light of one of Alexie\\'s most provocative comments in the interview, his parallel between the Indian and the Jewish Holocausts. Alexie\\'s texts can be considered trauma narratives, and the interview explores his views on trauma and the thematization of suffering. Although trauma does silence, and suffering does exist without expression in language and without metaphysics, the moment pain is transformed into suffering, it is also transferred into language. This enables the traumatized person to remember, work through, and mourn the lost object. Given the inarticulateness of many of Alexie\\'s characters, I also suggest that Alexie\\'s narratives call attention to the inherent difficulties of representing suffering. The characters are muted by the traumas of hatred and chaos, loss and grief danger and fear, and cannot--except in a few rare cases--articulate their suffering. Instead, they tend to resort to self-destructive behavior, including violence and substance abuse. Thus, while Alexie\\'s narratives demonstrate the need to give suffering a language, they also call attention to the inherent unsharability of suffering. In the interview with Alexie, I was particularly interested in his views on trauma and his thematization of suffering. While in Alexie\\'s early fiction, the reservation is a geographical space of borders and confinement, in his more recent fiction, The Toughest Indian in the World (2000) and Ten Little Indians (2003), the reservation changes its ontology and becomes a mental and emotional territory. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2005}, {\"paperId\": \"a0577aadf6826641b3443a517399ea83296c09b4\", \"title\": \"Claude Lanzmann\\'s Shoah: Key Essays\", \"abstract\": \"Claude Lanzmann\\'s monumental Shoah is the most celebrated film about the Holocaust ever made. For eleven years, Lanzmann traveled the world in search of those witnesses closest to the agony of the Jews of Europe during the Nazi terror. In superbly conducted, detailed interviews, rendered in searching, intimate close-ups, survivors disclose personal experiences at the limit of human expression. Thus we hear the invaluable testimonies of Richard Glazar and the barber Abraham Bomba, members of the Sonderkommando at Treblinka; of Simon Srebnik, the young boy who sang Polish and German songs as he walked through the streets of Chelmno in leg irons, and of the thousands of bodies he helped to burn; of the Czechoslovak Jew Filip Muller who survived five selections while serving in the Sonderkommando at Birkenau to witness the destruction of the Czech family camp; of Rudolf Vrba, who escaped from Birkenau to warn Hungarian Jews of their impending doom. Their first-hand accounts are confirmed in horrifying interviews Lanzmann conducted with former German guards and functionaries who scheduled the trains to the East; with average Polish farmers and townspeople who watched as their neighbors were taken away to their deaths; and with Polish heroes like Jan Karski, who tried in vain to warn Western leaders of the catastrophe unfolding on Polish soil.

Growing up in wartime Poland requires of the young narrator a virtually schizophrenic duality. She is constantly concerned with the peril of her own and her parents\\\\u2019 existence at the same time as she contends with \\\\u201cnormal\\\\u201d predicaments like adolescent crushes and teenage friendships. Maurer explicitly comments on Polish anti-Semitism when her narrator recalls how she moved her Polish teacher to tears when she performed a fragment of Henryk Sienkiewicz\\\\u2019s patriotic Trilogy (1884-1888). German authorities strictly prohibited the teaching of Polish literature and Maurer scripts this recital as a patriotic act, which makes her teacher weep openly. But when she recalls her recital, the narrator comments on Professor Piaskowska\\\\u2019s open anti-Semitism, teaching her pupils about Jews as an \\\\u201calien body\\\\u201d in Poland. Though Piaskowska qualifies her statements by calling what the Germans are doing \\\\u201ca crime,\\\\u201d she is clearly in favor of purging the nation of its \\\\u201cimpurities.\\\\u201d The narrator sees Piaskowska\\\\u2019s anti-Semitism as the most dangerous because in \\\\u201ccriticizing\\\\u201d the Germans, she feels patriotic and absolves herself of any participation in the crimes, implicitly approving of their outcome.

They put their heads down in heroic glory, but did so alone. Is it right that they passed away alone and those who remained passed away from memory while still alive?\\\\u201d Clearly recalling Zegota, the Polish organization that helped her own family escape Krakow, Maurer\\\\u2019s narrator concludes that Jewish victims of the Holocaust in Poland were forgotten because of anti-Semitism and those who helped them were forgotten because such aid found no national support. In \\\\u201cThe School,\\\\u201d Maurer\\\\u2019s use of Polish and her representation of the narrator as inseparably Polish and Jewish, despite being rejected by the country to which she pronounces allegiance, speak to the postwar national Polish consciousness.

In \\\\u201cTodesfuge\\\\u201d (\\\\u201cThe Death Fuge\\\\u201d), Paul Celan\\\\u2019s use of German and the pronoun \\\\u201cwe\\\\u201d as well as his parallels between Biblical figures and German literary characters call Germans to account for their wartime culpability. Similarly to Celan\\\\u2019s use of German, Maurer\\\\u2019s use of Polish and her direct critique of Polish wartime anti-Semitism call into account Poles\\\\u2019 culpability in the Holocaust.

Saul Friedlander, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1992: 240-258. 87 is no mistake that the Germans destroyed Eastern European Jewry, but it is also clear that Maurer refuses to repudiate her Polishness precisely by refusing to let Poles \\\\u201coff the hook.\\\\u201d By using Piaskowska as a stand in for Polish responses to the Holocaust, her work calls Poles to account for their actions long before Gross\\\\u2019s book sparked a debate about it in Poland and the United States. As early as the mid-1960s, Maurer questioned Polish Jewish relations and challenged long-standing notions of Polish wartime heroism. Popular wisdom in Poland still blames the lack of discussion about Polish Jewish relations on pre-1989 communist insistence that there were no distinctly ethnic victims of Hitler\\\\u2019s murderous agenda, but all were Polish citizens and workers slated for slaughter by a genocidal capitalist regime. But there was hardly any debate about Polish wartime culpability even after the antiSemitic purges of the 1950s and late 1960s, when the majority of Polish Jews who survived the Holocaust were displaced. Maurer\\\\u2019s stories set in the United States add another dimension to her complexly narrated identity constructions. While in Poland, Holocaust survivors like Maurer\\\\u2019s protagonist negotiate Polishness and Jewishness as markers of national, ethnic, or religious belonging; in the U.S. they become further marked by their immigrant status. In stories like \\\\u201cPolska Idealna\\\\u201d (\\\\u201cIdeal Poland,\\\\u201d 1970), Maurer describes how East European survivors\\\\u2019 wartime past, which becomes irrelevant in the U.S., constructs the immigrant Polish Jewish American identity. In \\\\u201cIdeal Poland,\\\\u201d there are three categories of newcomers from Poland: Jewish refugees who left immediately after the war, visiting scholars from the People\\\\u2019s Republic of Poland, and Jewish exiles who left because of the 1968 anti-Semitic purges. 88 In this story, the narrator, who is a refugee in Germany and then an immigrant in the United States, meets a middle-aged couple who represent Poland\\\\u2019s newest, post-1968 exiles. The couple simultaneously disarms and angers the narrator with \\\\u201ctheir enthusiasm of new immigrants.\\\\u201d She is disarmed because she can still remember the UNRRA times of looking forward to a promising immigrant future, but at the same time knows, through her own experiences, the illusory nature of those promises. She wants to \\\\u201cinject them with the knowledge of years spent wandering aimlessly, years of illusions, speaking foreign languages like a parrot. Constantly trying to enter an alien society.\\\\u201d And though she realizes the impossibility of actually hiring the man to do a series of lectures at the university\\\\u2019s East European Studies Institute, propelled by a sense of guilt and a certain desire to protect them from inevitable immigrant turmoil, she offers to try to do so anyway. The narrator\\\\u2019s co-immigrant guilt is exacerbated when she sees the place where the new immigrants live. Their apartment bespeaks their utterly marginal position in the \\\\u2018New World.\\\\u2019 Reeking of cabbage and soap, the building is decrepit and their apartment filled with junk. Everything about their situation appears familiar, but when she attempts to remember what the future looked like from the perspective of departure and loss, she can no longer access her once naive immigrant innocence and hope.

For many, hearing the clients\\' stories interacted with the clinicians\\' own stress levels and concerns about the terrorist attacks, heightening the resultant STS reaction beyond the simple additive effects of the two factors taken alone (Pulido, 2005). Such factors make it important to study STS among 9/11 social workers. OVERVIEW OF STS People may manifest symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder through secondhand exposure to the trauma histories of others (Figley, 1995a). Such cases include Holocaust survivors and their children (Danieli, 1985); intimates of rape victims (Kelly, 1988); and mental health professionals who work with trauma survivors (Figley, 1995b; Stamm, Varra, Pearlman, & Giller, 2002). An independent body of literature generated from the field of traumatology has emphasized the potential for harm to therapists who specialize in trauma therapy (Figley, 1995a, 1995b; Pearlman & MacIan, 1995). Therapists are exposed to the stressors and psychic pain experienced by their clients and also carry the professional burden of being expected to remain open and available to their clients on an emotional level. It is this empathic involvement that sets the stage for the potentially deleterious effects of therapy to affect the professional (Wilson & Raphael, 1993). Figley (1995a) defined STS as the natural consequent behaviors and emotions resulting from knowledge about a traumatizing event experienced by a significant other or from helping or wanting to help a traumatized person. In the process of learning about the traumatic material of the client and trying to understand and identify with the experience, the therapist may actually experience emotions and other symptoms similar to those of the victim. Dutton and Rubinstein (1995) categorized STS reactions or symptoms in three areas: (1) indicators of psychological distress or dysfunction, (2) changes in cognitive schema, and (3) relational disturbances. Individual, organizational, social, community, and traumatic event factors may potentially either increase or decrease one\\'s vulnerability to STS (Beaton & Murphy, 1995). Disaster mental health counselors may be at particularly high risk of STS, as they can be in an unfamiliar, sometimes dangerous setting and have to deal with an overwhelming number of clients and crises issues. STS is expected to be higher in disasters that are low in predictability and high in destruction and duration of impact, as was 9/11. The fact that 9/11 was a deliberate and intentional act may also heighten the potential for STS (Creamer & Liddle, 2005). WORKING WITH 9/11 CLIENTS The social workers\\' experiences differed on the basis of the type of 9/11 client. Some were dealing directly with family members who had lost loved ones, others dealt with people who fled the burning towers, and others worked with individuals considered \\\\\"indirectly\\\\\" exposed, but who were still fearful and symptomatic. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2007}, {\"paperId\": \"a44159fa6334ef18cdd3b1d6736a787fa991d5ea\", \"title\": \"Symptoms of Psychological Problems among Children of Holocaust Survivors: Faye Sholiton\\'s The Interview\", \"abstract\": null, \"year\": 2020}, {\"paperId\": \"a45bf7a5ff8b12814a664de20f0945b367b84386\", \"title\": \"The National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder PTSD RESEARCHQUARTERLY\", \"abstract\": \"On April 14, 2003, the International Human Ge\\\\u00ad nome Sequencing Consortium, led in the United States by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and the Department of Energy, announced that the human genome had been se\\\\u00ad quenced. With the Human Genome Project com\\\\u00ad plete, NHGRI has outlined its vision for the future of genetics research (Collins et al., 2003). A major new focus is the development of tools to identify genes that contribute to common, complex disor\\\\u00ad ders including mental disorders such as PTSD. As we are entering the \\\\u201cera of the genome,\\\\u201d the time has come for considering the current state of the literature on the genetics of PTSD. From the vantage point of genetics research, PTSD is considered a complex or polygenetic disorder. Unlike Huntington\\\\u2019s disease and other disorders that are caused by a single gene, there is likely no \\\\u201cPTSD gene\\\\u201d that is necessary and sufficient for the development of the disorder. Instead, there are probably many different genes, each of which con\\\\u00ad tributes interchangeably and additively, in a proba\\\\u00ad bilistic fashion, to the inherited liability for PTSD. Genetics research in PTSD has followed a logical series of steps, similar to that of genetics research on other disorders. First, family studies were conducted. If PTSD is genetic, family members of individuals with PTSD should have a higher prevalence of PTSD. PTSD prevalence should be higher in firstdegree relatives (parents, siblings, children) than secondor third-degree relatives because first-degree relatives share more of their genes. Next, twin studies have shown the relative magnitude of genetic and environmental influences on individual differences in trauma exposure and PTSD. More recently, candidate gene association studies have sought to identify specific genes that increase risk of PTSD. Family studies. There are two main methods for conducting family studies: the family history method and the family study method. Both methods begin by selecting cases and controls, which are called probands in genetic studies. The family history method collects psychiatric information about all family members by interviewing the proband. Family history studies are conducted using instruments designed for this purpose such as the Family Interview for Genetic Studies (FIGS). The family study method, on the other hand, interviews all family members directly using an instrument such as the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (DIGS). Family studies of PTSD have primarily used some variation of the family history method. The family history method has several well-documented limitations. Overall, family history studies tend to underestimate the prevalence of mental disorders in relatives. Moreover, proband reports of diagnostic status in relatives are influenced by their own history of psychopathology (Khoury et al., 1993). Compared with other disorders, such as major depression, relatively few family studies of PTSD have been conducted. Most evidence for the role of familial risk factors in PTSD comes from epide\\\\u00ad miological studies. The results of such studies are contradictory. Moreover, most suggest familial psychopathology increases risk of both trauma exposure and PTSD, although the mechanism by which this occurs is unclear. A family history of psychopathology could increase risk of PTSD di\\\\u00ad rectly or indirectly. In my own study of familial risk factors for PTSD, I found that a family history of conduct disorder, major depression, panic disorder or GAD, and substance dependence were each significantly associated with PTSD. However, this association is indirect, mediated by increased risk of trauma exposure and pretrauma psychopathology (Koenen et al., 2002). Only a few family studies have specifically ex\\\\u00ad amined whether relatives of PTSD probands have an increased prevalence of PTSD. In one such study, Sack and colleagues (1995) compared the preva\\\\u00ad lence of PTSD in Cambodian refugee children whose parents had PTSD with the prevalence in refugee children whose parents did not develop PTSD. When compared to children whose parents did not have PTSD, children whose mothers or fathers had PTSD were almost five times more likely to receive the diagnosis. Similar findings have been shown in a series of studies on adult children of Holocaust survivors with PTSD. Results of this work show that these children have a higher risk of PTSD following trauma exposure than adult children of Holocaust survivors without PTSD (Yehuda et al., 1998; Yehuda et al., 2001). One difficulty for family studies of PTSD is that the disorder cannot be assessed in relatives who have not experienced a traumatic event. Since it is unknown whether these relatives would have developed PTSD had they been exposed, information on PTSD diagnostic status for such relatives must be treated as missing data. To get around this problem, several family studies have examined whether\", \"year\": 2002}, {\"paperId\": \"a46b63d6f7c721d1ddeb14cc041e420ce8b71972\", \"title\": \"Child Survivors of the Holocaust \\\\u2014 Strategies of Adaptation *\", \"abstract\": \"Child survivors have only recently been recognized as a developmentally distinct group with psychological experiences different from older survivors.

Beth Cohen\\\\u2019s well-researched volume is the latest work on a topic that has been debated in both the scholarly and popular literature since the end of World War II: the question of how well Holocaust survivors adapted to life after the war. Cohen\\\\u2019s focus is on the one-third who came to America. In the early postwar period, many articles emphasizing the successful adjustment of the immigrants appeared in the general media and in publications such as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society\\\\u2019s Rescue. But there was an agenda here. The agencies that served the new arrivals wanted the doors to Jewish immigration to remain open, and they therefore portrayed the survivors as resilient, eager, and ready to start new lives. A somewhat different picture was presented by social-work professionals, prominent among them Carol Meyer, Elaine Mishkin, and Mary Russak. Their work detailed the problems that aid workers faced in dealing with the DPs, but offered a cautiously optimistic finding that, with proper help, survivors could succeed in America. Beginning in the mid-1950s, less was written on the topic. The survivors themselves were busy rebuilding their lives; the traumas that they had endured were buried as they raised families and pursued careers. Then, in the 1970s and 1980s, the survivors\\\\u2019 inability to forget became the focus of extensive research in the fields of psychology and psychiatry. Basing themselves largely on interviews with their own patients, scholars such as Henry Krystal, William Niederland, Milton Jucovy, Martin Bergmann, and Leo Eitinger argued that the survivors had been seriously and permanently damaged by their suffering. In the 1990s, the intellectual ground shifted yet again, as new research by Boaz and Eva Kahana, John Sigal, Morton Weinfeld, the author of this review, and others, found that the survivors had done quite well despite their trauma. Previous research had over-emphasized maladjustment, they found, because it tended to focus on those who had been in therapy rather than on the \\\\u201ctypical\\\\u201d survivor.

The implications of Wolf\\\\u2019s work for Holocaust studies center on the character of Jewish families and the almost insuperable difficulty of returning to a normal life after this most extraordinary and traumatic of periods.

Indeed, professors of French pioneered the study of trauma in literature, which originated in the 1990s, as a way of interpreting texts relating to the Second World War and specifically to the Holocaust or Shoah. This trend has yet to run its course. When my department tan a search for a new assistant professor of twentieth-century French literature two years ago, more than a few candidates applied with what seemed to be identical dissertations devoted to trauma in the testimonial narratives of Charlotte Delbo, Saul Friedlander, Georges Perec, Claude Lanzmann, and Marguerite Duras, or some combination thereof. For what it\\'s worth, however, the Romanic Review seems to have remained trauma-free, at least through the end of the 1990s. Adapted from a clinical context, trauma theory presupposes an event too horrific to be psychically assimilated by a perceiving subject. Unable to process this event or move beyond it, the subject remains bound to it in ways he or she cannot consciously grasp. Manifestations of the trauma emerge in the subject\\'s actions, but more significantly in language, through points of logical disjuncture in testimonial narrative and endless metaphorical figurations of a truth that cannot be named. If these linguistic effects of trauma sound reminiscent of the way that certain deconstructionist critics characterize all language, or all writing, this is not a coincidence. Many of the most prominent literary theorists of trauma, such as Shoshana Felman, were associated with deconstruction and with the leading deconstructionist critic, Paul de Man, who was Felman\\'s colleague at Yale until his death 1983. It hardly seems a coincidence that the rise of trauma as a critical paradigm followed the revelation in 1987 that de Man had published a series of collaborationist and anti-Semitic articles as a young journalist in Belgium during World War II. To be sure, the de Man controversy occupies a central place in Testimony\\\\\" Crises of Witnessing in Literature, Psychoanalysis, and History, authored by Felman in conjunction with the psychiatrist Dori Laub, which, perhaps more than any other book, helped popularize trauma theory in literary studies. An attempt to account for the unique problems involved in representing the Holocaust, Testimony juxtaposes chapters by Laub on survivor testimony with a series of essays by Felman on Albert Camus, Claude Lanzmann, and de Man. In the section on de Man, Felman portrays her late colleague as a survivor of catastrophe who, like the concentration camp survivors interviewed by Laub, bears exemplary witness to \\\\\"the trauma of contemporary history\\\\\" through his silence and refusal to confess his collaborationist past (Felman 164). In Representing the Holocaust: History, Theory, Trauma, Dominic LaCapra offers perhaps the most biting critique of Felman\\'s chapter on de Man, showing how she inadvertently supplies the very confession she deems unnecessary. (1) The attacks leveled at certain key manifestations of trauma theory have not stopped it from gaining currency as a tool for examining representations not only of the Holocaust and World War II but of other historical periods as well. In fact, and this will be the real subject of this essay, one of the main arenas of its deployment has been nineteenth-century studies. The French nineteenth century was not without its own horrific events, many of which were, if not as uniquely horrible as World War II, nevertheless worthy of inspiring trauma. Napoleon\\'s Russian campaign comes to mind, in which over a million people are estimated to have been killed (including 300,000 French soldiers). One also thinks of the cholera epidemic of 1832 (20,000 dead in Paris; 100,000 in France) and the Crimean War, in which over 70,000 French soldiers died from wounds and disease alone. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2010}, {\"paperId\": \"a8d19e4fa26b9400ecd164a2639eaaf0cd4ad04b\", \"title\": \"What happened next\", \"abstract\": \"This title contains: Richard Ford interviewed by Tim Adams: the aftermath of Dirty Realism; Owen Sheers on the consequences of Christmas Island\\'s nuclear past; Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie on the death of her high-school sweetheart; Katya Krausova on the survivors of the Slovakian Holocaust; Roberto Saviano on the streets of Naples; and Kitty Hauser on OGS Crawford: pioneering aerial photographer, utopian socialist and English eccentric.

In this article a prospective, case-comparison study was conducted in order to assess the association between Holocaust experience and quality-of-life of older patients before and after an open-heart surgery, and to examine factors associated with differences in quality-of-life. Sixty-four Holocaust survivors and 53 comparison patients who were not exposed to a major trauma were interviewed in the Department of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery at Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel before open-heart surgery, and 60 Holocaust survivors and 47 comparison patients were interviewed at 6 months. The interview included background data, mastery scale, and quality-of-life measured by the Nottingham Health Profile. Medical data were retrieved from the patients\\' charts. The Holocaust survivors reported greater problems than the comparison patients only in emotional reactions and pain components of quality-of-life at admission, and in emotional reactions and energy at follow-up. The improvement in quality-of-life over time was similar in both groups. In multivariate analyses of emotional reaction, the differences between the groups at admission remained statistically significant after controlling for education and medical status but disappeared when mastery was included. At follow-up, being a Holocaust survivor (OR = 2.56, 95% CI = 1.0\\\\u20136.6), and having lower education and lower feelings of mastery were associated with higher levels of emotional reaction. The moderate differences indicate that older Holocaust survivors are not more vulnerable to problems in quality-of-life when confronted with this life-threatening medical condition.

Drawing on a range of oral history interviews, I examine how place functions in oral history narratives in complex ways. On the most obvious level, the events being described not only occurred in a different time but also a different place with distance and disjuncture in both time and space significant as the then and there is narrated in the here and now. But what is more striking are the ways in which microgeographies function as ways of meditating difficult events. In the cases discussed, Holocaust survivors (and others close to them) go places in their memory that they never went in reality and went places in reality where they are not willing to go in their memory. Taken together, it appears that survivors adopt a range of spatial strategies of memory as they physically place themselves vis-\\\\u00e0-vis others in Holocaust landscapes as a way of narrating familial separation and violence.

This terrible fact is supported by evidence demonstrating the large number of genocides that have occurred since the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in 1948, the best known of which took place in Cambodia, the Former Yugoslavia, and Rwanda, although there were many others. Hundreds of books have been written about the Rwandan Genocide and although far fewer have been written about the atrocities in Darfur, there are still plenty to choose from. While only deniers contest that what transpired in Rwanda was clearly a case of genocide, the arguments over how to classify violence in Darfur have been more complex and uncertain. Some have deemed the conflict to be ethnic cleansing or crimes against humanity, while others assert it was clearly genocide. Interestingly, while the United States government deemed it genocide, the United Nations International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur (COI) asserted that it was a case of crimes against humanity. Just as critics of the US position claim that power politics were at the heart of the decision to call Darfur genocide, critics of the COI decision claim that a different set of political interests drove the COI\\\\u2019s position. In addition to this ongoing geopolitical debate over the appropriateness of applying the \\\\u201cG\\\\u201d word to the Darfuri case, scholars remain entrenched on different sides of this debate. Making a powerful case for identifying and raising awareness about genocide are two new books by Samuel Totten: We Cannot Forget: Interviews with Survivors of the 1994 Genocide in Rwanda (co-edited with Rafiki Ubaldo) and An Oral and Documentary History of the Darfur Genocide. These masterful works combine oral history with scholarly analysis and official documents to challenge naysayers\\\\u2019 arguments. Both collections use interview data to effectively demonstrate that the human turmoil that took place in Rwanda and Sudan was motivated by an overarching theme of genocidal intent, perhaps the most useful concept for distinguishing genocide from war crimes. The interviews in We Cannot Forget add greatly to our understanding of events and perceptions surrounding the horrific, 100-day genocide in Rwanda, which resulted in 500,000 to 1 million deaths. As relatively few Rwandan survivor testimonies make it into this type of literature, Totten and Ubaldo address a significant lacuna.

One hopes that Robert Jay Lifton\\'s study may not suffer from the ennui this surfeit has begun to impose on the nation\\'s readership. How did men and women trained, sworn and professionally fulfilled as healers ease into the task of mass murder? Through nearly a decade spent reading the archival records and interviewing former Nazi physicians, imprisoned physicians who worked under their orders, and survivors of their ministrations, psychiatrist Lifton found that most Nazi doctors were quite ordinary: \\\\\"neither inherently evil nor particularly ethically sensitive\\\\\" (p. 4). Yet, if they were banal people, their work was demonic, and Lifton wanted to know what grotesque shift enabled healers to be killers. It has become a convention to insist that any comparison of the Holocaust to other acts of murderous inhumanity dishonors the Jews who perished at Nazi hands. Lifton is not of that mind. His insights into the motivations of Nazi doctors aspire to \\\\\"raise broader questions about human behavior, about ways in which people, individually and collectively, can embrace various forms of destructiveness and evil, with or without the awareness of doing so\\\\\" (p. 417).

These are some of the central questions addressed in the present paper, which suggests that the purpose of incorporating Judeo-Spanish to these stories is to render them more powerful and to make the Judeo-Spanish experience more accessible to those who are not part of it. It is interesting to note that it is the very fact that Judeo-Spanish was a minority language in the extermination camps which makes the life stories of its speakers who survived particularly forceful.

Only a few studies have been undertaken among civilian survivors of WWII. Objectives The purpose of this study was to examine the association between perceived social acknowledgment of WWII trauma and the level of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive symptoms among Polish survivors of WWII by employing a mixed-methods design (i.e., a quantitative analysis supported by qualitative interviews). Method In the quantitative part, 123 participants filled out: the list of WWII-related traumatic events, the PTSD Checklist for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (PCL-5), the shortened version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and the Social Acknowledgment Questionnaire (SAQ). In the qualitative part, an interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) of participants\\\\u2019 reminiscences of WWII was examined. Results Although we observed a direct positive association between the number of WWII-related traumatic events and the intensity of PTSD and depressive symptoms, these relationships changed when we entered the social acknowledgment construct into the model. Specifically, we found that perceived social acknowledgment (general disapproval) was a mediator of the relationship between the number of WWII traumatic events and the intensity of PTSD symptoms only, and not of depressive symptoms. In the qualitative part, three themes relating to traumatic reminiscences emerged among the participants: parental efficacy, parental betrayal, and support from the invader.

The \\\\u010cetniks, a remnant of the Royal Serbian army, primarily hunted the Jews. Historians as well as survivors were eager to expose the atrocities so that people around the globe would know what had happened. Although there is a plethora of historiographic literature on the machinery of murder in the Serbian and Croatian death camps, it is plagued by disputes over the number of victims. Moreover, much of it is written to defend one or another ethnic perspective.

Because Israeli does not know Serbo-Croatian, his bibliography lacks primary sources, including diaries, memoirs, contemporary newspapers, and interviews with those who experienced these years. The book is based essentially on secondary sources, predominantly books written or translated into English (pp. 191\\\\u2013193).

The Death Camps of Croatia loses focus on its stated subject when it ventures from wartime Yugoslavia and its concentration camps to present-day conflicts. In particular, by introducing a totally irrelevant Middle East connection with a follow-up on the Muslim connection and Haj-Aminal-Husseini, it needlessly confuses readers. Despite Israeli\\\\u2019s intent to relate his subject to current issues, his chapter \\\\u201cThe Suppression of War Memories and Their Reemergence\\\\u201d largely ignores the current situation in Croatia.

He is still an accomplished pianist, and has said that \\\\\"playing the piano is my therapy.\\\\\" The melding of his musical and theatrical talents eventually was realized during the summer of 1980 with his highly acclaimed rendering of the Pirate King in Joseph Papp\\'s The Pirates of Penzance in New York\\'s Central Park, after Kline had moved on to the Julliard Drama Center and after he had gained much theatrical experience as a founding member of John Houseman\\'s Acting Company. During his four years with The Acting Company, Kline played lead roles in a classical repertoire that included The School for Scandal, She Stoops to Conquer, The Three Sisters, and The Lower Depths. More recently Kevin Kline played Shakespeare\\'s Richard III and Henry V to very good notices. Frank Rich of The New York Times wrote, for example, \\\\\"Mr. Kline is a grand King,\\\\\" against whom \\\\\"most other American actors of his generation are mere pretenders to the throne.\\\\\" Kline won his first Tony Award for his Broadway debut in the musical On the Twentieth Century (with Imogene Coca, Madeline Kahn, and John Cullum), then was featured in Michael Weller\\'s play Loose Ends that opened at Washington\\'s Arena Stage before moving on to Broadway. In Los Angeles he played with Marurice Evans, Sally Kellerman, and Marisa Berenson in the Ahmanson Theatre revival of Philip Barry\\'s Holiday, first introduced in 1928. Kevin Kline\\'s breakthrough performance, however, was with Linda Ronstadt, Rex Smith, and George Rose in The Pirates of Penzance, first in Central Park, then, later, on Broadway. That performacne won a second Tony Award for Kline as Best Actor in a Musical Comedy and assured him of a role in the motion picture version of Penzance. After director Alan J. Pakula had seen Kline\\'s Pirate King on Broadway, he was so impressed that he signed Kline for the role of Nathan in his screen adaptation of William Styron\\'s novel Sophie\\'s Choice, with Meryl Streep and Peter MacNicol. Kline told The New York Times (12 December 1982) that he prepared for that role \\\\\"by reading up on subjects ranging from the Holocaust to the work of R. D. Laing.\\\\\" His mother was Roman Catholic and he was educated by the Benedictine monks in St. Louis, but his father was Jewish, and this biographical link helped him to understand Nathan \\\\\"in terms of understanding what it meant to be a Jew in 1947, when people were finding out about \\'The Final Solution,\\' the guilt of survivors,\\\\\" he told The New York Times, and \\\\\"Nathan\\'s guilt about not being part of it, about being safe and sound in Brooklyn while his people were being annihilated.\\\\\" Kline\\'s next movie was The Big Chill, directed by Lawrence Kasdan in South Carolina, a larger popular success than Sophie\\'s Choice, one supposes, because of its story and often nostalgic 1960s ambience. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 1986}, {\"paperId\": \"ae01fd69955380a0b5a73beab8a1b1e51b0a1ee0\", \"title\": \"Exodus to Berlin: The Return of the Jews to Germany\", \"abstract\": \"In the years following the Holocaust, the Jewish community in Germany was tiny, decimated by the Nazis and shrinking fast as most survivors died or emigrated. But once the Berlin Wall fell, the German government invited Soviet-bloc Jews to come make a new life in prosperous and democratic Germany. Exodus to Berlin tells the story of that migration. Since 1989 more than 100,000 Jews have accepted Germany\\'s invitation, filling Berlin and the rest of the country with a vibrant subculture. Germany now wakes up to synagogues filling for services, bagels and blintzes in new restaurants, and the mournful strains of Klezmer music in clubs and street festivals. Jews are finding sanctuary in Germany from the anti-Semitism, violence, and economic chaos that plague the former Soviet empire.

In December 1987, when the First Intifada broke out, I was on duty as the psychologist of the southern region of the IDF in the reserves, and I was supposed to be recruited only in emergency situations. I was on leave from teaching at the university and was spending my time writing about my interviews with descendants of Nazi perpetrators in Germany (Bar-On 1989). More specifically, I felt as if I were being torn apart, wrestling with the question of whether I should continue to write about the legacy of the Holocaust from the perspective of the descendants of the survivors and the perpetrators, or whether I should attempt to contribute within the realm of the newly evolving catastrophe raging in the country. Indeed, I was spending every evening watching televised footage of Israeli soldiers responding with violence to Palestinian protesters in the West Bank and Gaza. I called my colleague, Professor Charlie Greenbaum from the Hebrew University, who had the equivalent military role in the central region.

The idea that a \\\\\"novelist\\\\\" must \\\\\"cope honestly\\\\\" with aggression produces a tension between narrative plot and historical relevance. At times, the historical backdrop of his novels threatens to outweigh the fictive impact; at times, however, the thematic message resonates with historical memory and the two work to complement each other. This uneasy balance is most readily evident in Potok\\'s novels that contain a Jewish theme, because these novels regularly include the Shoah as the backdrop to other kinds of violence set in the foreground. So, for example, Davita\\'s Harp, which is set between 1936 and 1942, primarily involves the fight against fascism and the Spanish Civil War and, secondarily, involves the destruction of European Jewry. In My Name Is Asher Lev, the figure of Jacob Kahn, the artist who teaches Asher Lev, and his wife, Tanya, are the background figures whose aesthetic and religious outlook has been informed by the death of family members in Nazi Germany. In The Gift of Asher Lev, Asher\\'s wife is a Holocaust survivor and her history and the loss of her family inspires their return to his family\\'s home. This article focuses primarily on the violence found in Potok\\'s first two novels, The Chosen (1967), and its sequel, The Promise (1969), because these novels, as his earliest published work, set the pattern for later novels in terms of representing the Shoah and negotiating its place in a fictional setting. Both novels are set in the late 1930s and 1940s; The Chosen takes place during the years of World War II and The Promise, set during its aftermath, serves as a historical and fictional continuation. Certainly, the violence of these two novels is advanced and colored by the violence of the Second World War, and, more specifically, the destruction of European Jewry, which serves as their historical backdrop.

DVWW-OPJENU. $32.98. In the early twentieth century, opera underwent a sea change as the dissonant strands of musical modernism and the burgeoning ideas of psychology began to drift onto the stage. Audiences, caught in a rapidly industrializing world, sought to understand their situation through the theater. Composers, for their part, embraced the new freedoms granted by those shifting audience expectations and began telling stories unlike those that already existed. Many scaled back their scope, weaving tales of more modest proportions, while others delved into the inner world of thought and belief, both conscious and unconscious. These two admittedly broad responses, among the many from the period, are clearly borne out in the recent DVD releases of Leos Janacek\\'s and Arnold Schoenberg\\'s greatest operatic works, Jenufa and Moses und Aron. The nature of these DVDs speaks both to the place of these works in the modern repertoire and to the shifting current of modern audience expectation. Schoenberg\\'s Moses und Aron is often acknowledged as one of the composer\\'s masterpieces in the twelve-tone language, but its troubled compositional history, daunting stage directions, and undramatic subject matter have kept it out of the performing repertoire. Schoenberg first conceived the work in 1922 as a cantata, but by 1930, had refashioned it into an opera libretto. He began composing the work and finished its first two acts by 1932, but he stalled there and never completed the work nor saw any of it performed. In fact, as the director of this particular production, Reto Nickler, notes in an interview included with the DVD, that Schoenberg did not think the work performable. With Moses und Aron, Schoenberg turned to operatic territory unexplored neither in his earlier Erwartung (1909) and Die gluckliche Hand (1910-13), nor in many other contemporaneous operas, namely the metaphysical. Moses and Aron represent for Schoenberg two different responses to spiritual revelation, and through them, he explored the nature of human faith and his ambiguity toward his own resurfacing Jewish identity. That search for a Jewish identity is given primacy over the question of faith in Nickler\\'s production for the Vienna State Opera in 2006. Nickler created a tensely charged atmosphere absent in other productions by casting the characters and chorus as Holocaust survivors. The resulting severity of the staging, costume design, and lighting pulls the viewer\\'s attention to the words and forces one to choose between Moses\\'s direction of faith and singularity outside of culture and Aron\\'s path toward assimilation, which ultimately, according to this production, leads to death. Unfortunately, the power of Nickler\\'s production choice is broken by the over-the-top nature of his staging of the act 2 centerpiece, Der Tanz um das goldene Kalb. The chorus of Jews assimilates into an Ayran culture by donning blond wigs and gold costumes to fall prostrate before a giant, golden \\\\\"ICH,\\\\\" while Aron instructs them to \\\\\"worship yourself in this image.\\\\\" The use of pictures of the chorus\\'s faces and a bank of giant television monitors is innovative and jarring, but undercuts the immediacy of Moses\\'s challenge by reducing it to spectacle. By the time Moses returns to the stage with the Ten Commandments, and the original production design resurfaces, the flow of Schoenberg\\'s argument is lost. Any production of Moses und Aron must contend with the lack of a final act; this production wisely chose to end with act 2. However, the DVD release includes the fascinating special feature of Franz Grundheber, who is mesmerizing as Moses, reading the final words of Schoenberg\\'s libretto for act 3. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2008}, {\"paperId\": \"b19d61afe4bdc923b4e60850f26ff79dd6310483\", \"title\": \"L\\\\u2019infinie solitude du rescap\\\\u00e9\", \"abstract\": \"To retake, in these few pages, the journey of encounter with the Tutsi genocide in Rwanda \\\\u2013 a long journey of listening and writing that still goes on \\\\u2013 means, above all, a new opportunity to convey the voices of survivors such as Marie, Esther, Theophila... among others.

One reason it fell short of its nefarious goal was the work of brave non-Jews who sheltered their fellow citizens. In most countries under German control, those who rescued Jews risked imprisonment and death. In Poland, home to more Jews than any other country at the start of World War II and location of six German-built death camps, the punishment was immediate execution. This book tells the stories of Polish Holocaust survivors and their rescuers. The authors traveled extensively in the United States and Poland to interview some of the few remaining participants before their generation is gone. Tammeus and Cukierkorn unfold many stories that have never before been made public: gripping narratives of Jews who survived against all odds and courageous non-Jews who risked their own lives to provide shelter. These are harrowing accounts of survival and bravery. Maria Devinki lived for more than two years under the floors of barns. Felix Zandman sought refuge from Anna Puchalska for a night, but she pledged to hide him for the whole war if necessary - and eventually hid several Jews for seventeen months in a pit dug beneath her house. Through some twenty stories like these, Tammeus and Cukierkorn show that even in an atmosphere of unimaginable malevolence, individuals can decide to act in civilized ways. Some rescuers had antisemitic feelings but acted because they knew and liked individual Jews. In many cases, the rescuers were simply helping friends or business associates. The accounts include the perspectives of men and women, city and rural residents, clergy and laypersons - even children who witnessed their parents\\' efforts. These stories show that assistance from non-Jews was crucial, but also that Jews needed ingenuity, sometimes money, and most often what some survivors called simple good luck.

Engaging in life review at the end of life, he argued, was good for the patient, mostly in terms of morale and sense of identity. Yet all of life is punctuated by stories, some more beneficial than others. At every stage narratives can prepare people for the future or steel them to bear the troubles and routines of the present. Moreover, these stories can disclose other folkways or recall past events that otherwise would be denied or forgotten. Ordinarily these tales offer a positive message. They provide a perspective on the future radier than a dread of things to come. Still others reveal the possibilities of regeneration. From them we learn about individuals who have not only survived trauma but learned to flourish far from the land of their birth. With varying degrees of accuracy at every stage of life, narratives can prepare us for the imagined future.1 These reflections were brought home to me a few weeks before Christmas 2002. Our grandson, Anders, went into tiie hospital with R.S.V., a respiratory disease about which I knew nothing. Realizing that daycare was hardly the place for him to recuperate, I rushed out to St. Paul to help him through the crisis. The last time I\\'d had full-time responsibility for a baby was more than thirty years past. Not surprisingly, I gained a new respect for the potential of television, a lesson mothers learn very quickly. Being eight months old, Anders was too young for books unless they were chewable. So in the afternoons to break the monotony of life outside of daycare, we watched the screen together. He liked such programs on Public Television as Arthur, Sagwa, the Chinese Siamese Cat, and Clifford. Upon reflection I realized that he was being exposed to new cultures and to a slightly different age group. The cats, dogs, and monkeys in Sagwa were older and more independent than our infant, and Amy Tan\\'s line drawings represented a Chinese culture of days gone by. The program reminded me of stories set in China that I had read as a child and of how fascinating the unfamiliar settings had been. Arthur and Clifford were American tales, but the children were once again older than our grandchild. All of these programs held out hope that his next stage of development was worth anticipating, for a world existed far beyond his temporary limitations. Children\\'s books, however, are not the only ones to anticipate the next stage of life. For example, Connie Goldman\\'s (2002) Gifts of Caregiving presents a bearable picture of the dfuture to midlife adults whose relatives arc beginning to fail. Fortunately, Goldman\\'s interviews with people taking care of demented or frail relatives demonstrate the positive rewards of this task as well as the difficulties. One may have to sacrifice time, effort, and money, but most of the people Goldman talked to mentioned the benefits of their new roles. Such stories are useful to sustain morale when one is faced with similar challenges. The memory of these narratives could help us persist long enough to find the potential rewards for ourselves. Other stories teach us about past events that might be denied or forgotten. Some of these recollections, especially narratives of the Holocaust, are especially difficult for those who endured wartime atrocities. For example, spring 2002 I interviewed an 85-year-old Holocaust survivor named Gertrude Kupfer (2002) in Richmond, Virginia. Over a period of hours she described her experience as a slave laborer. By talking to me she hoped to educate an expanding number of people about what really happened to Jews under the Germans. Like most survivors, she is deeply troubled by Holocaust deniers, who claim that few Jews died or were mistreated in the Hitler regime. Moreover, she fears that children will not learn the truth about the past unless she and others like her speak up. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2003}, {\"paperId\": \"b2c404f8c3a3f59518e34bbef3aa31aad8d73c81\", \"title\": \"Memories of Holocaust-related traumatic experiences, sense of coherence, and survivors\\' subjective well-being in late life: some puzzling findings\", \"abstract\": \"Background and Objectives: This study explores the nexus of relationships between memories of Holocaust-related early traumatic events, survivors\\\\u2019 sense of coherence (SOC), and subjective well-being (SWB) in late life.

DESIGN: We interviewed 295 HS, 205 other older Israelis, and 335 older Canadians each of whom completed the Life Satisfaction Scale with items measuring both concurrent and retrospective aspects. Separate confirmatory factor analytic models were computed for each group. RESULTS: Overall, levels of life satisfaction were indistinguishable across groups. Both concurrent and retrospective items contributed significantly to measurement of a single latent construct. Yet differences between groups in the latent structure of response to certain scale items emerged. CONCLUSIONS: It may be that HS report high life satisfaction not despite, but because of, experiencing early life trauma, juxtaposing early years with the comparatively good conditions of their lives today.\", \"year\": 2018}, {\"paperId\": \"b5a92595d9f3f065597721a740f1225f68a157b5\", \"title\": \"Museum-Based Teacher Education: Teacher Meaning-Making at a Jewish Heritage Museum\", \"abstract\": \"MUSEUM-BASED TEACHER EDUCATION: TEACHER MEANING-MAKING AT A JEWISH HERITAGE MUSEUM David Russell Goldberg This study answers the question of what meanings teacher-participants make in Holocaust professional development at a Jewish heritage museum in a mandate state. By understanding these meanings, the educational community can better understand how a particular context and approach influences teacher meaning-making and the ways in which museum teacher education programs shape the learning of participants. Meaningmaking is a process of interpretation and understanding experiences in ways that make sense to each individual teacher. Meanings that are formed may impact teachers\\\\u2019 pedagogic interpretation of the Holocaust, which may in turn shape their instructional practices. This instrumental case study used multiple interviews, observations, surveys and documents to explore the meanings teachers make about the Holocaust from participation in Holocaust professional development at a Jewish heritage museum. Participants in the study included nine teachers from public schools and private Jewish schools and two professional developers from the Museum. Each participant was interviewed three times, and six different professional development programs were observed over a period of six months. Programs typically lasted from one to six days and included a presentation by museum staff, Holocaust experts, and survivors. At any museum, each representation of the Holocaust conveys particular messages and mediates Holocaust history through a particular lens. This study reveals insights about how intended aims are interpreted in Holocaust professional development. Three categories emerged of meanings teachers made, namely (1) the hopeful narrative, (2) identity, and (3) the emotional narrative of the Holocaust. This study contributes to the larger field of professional development by partially filling in an area of missing scholarship on Holocaust professional development. Findings from this study may be used to plan future professional development programs on the Holocaust, as well as on other topics, through a deeper understanding of the meanings teachers make of multiple programs at one site.\", \"year\": 2012}, {\"paperId\": \"b6280150bd224c8b9399b1089cb5085a0b0db1db\", \"title\": \"The Response of the Other Survivors and Press Response to Playing for Time\", \"abstract\": null, \"year\": 2016}, {\"paperId\": \"b634f2915a73b3e4a60f7167bfcdbff984aab3c1\", \"title\": \"The role of music in terms of the relationship between Holocaust survivors and their children, the second generation\", \"abstract\": \"Introduction: Inter-generation interaction is disrupted after major traumatic experience.

(1) \\\\\"The killer apes learned nothing from the twin towers of Auschwitz and Hiroshima,\\\\\" Spiegelman writes; 9/11 is the \\\\\"same old deadly business as usual\\\\\" (n. pag.). Produced serially, Spiegelman\\'s No Towers comic strips were too politically incendiary to find wide release in the United States; they were largely published abroad and in New York\\'s weekly Jewish newspaper the Forward. In the Shadow of No Towers powerfully asserts that \\\\\"the shadow of a past time [interweaves] with a present time,\\\\\" to use Spiegelman\\'s own description of his Pulitzer-prize winning two-volume work Maus: A Survivor\\'s Tale (Spiegelman qtd. in Silverblatt 35). In one telling panel there the bodies of four Jewish girls hanged in World War II dangle from trees in the Catskills as the Spiegel-mans drive to the supermarket in 1979 (figure 1). (2) [FIGURE 1 OMITTED] The persistence of the past in Maus, of course, does figure prominently in analyses of the text\\'s overall representational strategies. We see this, for instance, in Dominick LaCapra\\'s reading of the book\\'s \\\\\"thematic mode of carnivalization\\\\\" (175), Andreas Huyssen\\'s theorizing of Adornean mimesis in Maus, and Alan Rosen\\'s study of Vladek Spiegelman\\'s broken English. (3) Most readings of how Maus represents history approach the issue in terms of ongoing debates about Holocaust representation, in the context of postmodernism, or in relation to theories of traumatic memory. But such readings do not pay much attention to Maus\\'s narrative form: (4) the specificities of reading graphically, of taking individual pages as crucial units of comics grammar. The form of Maus, however, is essential to how it represents history. Indeed, Maus\\'s contribution to thinking about the \\\\\"crisis in representation,\\\\\" I will argue, is precisely in how it proposes that the medium of comics can approach and express serious, even devastating, histories. (5) \\\\\"I\\'m literally giving a form to my father\\'s words and narrative,\\\\\" Spiegelman observes about Maus, \\\\\"and that form for me has to do with panel size, panel rhythms, and visual structures of the page\\\\\" (Interview with Gary Groth 105, emphasis in original). As I hope to show, to claim that comics makes language, ideas, and concepts \\\\\"literal\\\\\" is to call attention to how the medium can make the twisting lines of history readable through form. When critics of Maus do examine questions of form, they often focus on the cultural connotations of comics rather than on the form\\'s aesthetic capabilities--its innovations with space and temporality. (6) Paul Buhle, for instance, claims, \\\\\"More than a few readers have described [Maus] as the most compelling of any [Holocaust] depiction, perhaps because only the caricatured quality of comic art is equal to the seeming unreality of an experience beyond all reason\\\\\" (16). Where Michael Rothberg contends, \\\\\"By situating a nonfictional story in a highly mediated, unreal, \\'comic\\' space, Spiegelman captures the hyperintensity of Auschwitz\\\\\" (206), Stephen Tabachnick suggests that Maus may work \\\\\"because it depicts what was all too real, however unbelievable, in a tightly controlled and brutally stark manner. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2006}, {\"paperId\": \"b7a35d744d8be36173bce01f6396ac3184a2924b\", \"title\": \"Holocaust and Memory: The Experience of the Holocaust and its Consequences, An Investigation Based on Personal Narratives\", \"abstract\": \"Originally published in Polish to great acclaim and based on interviews with survivors of the Holocaust in Poland, Holocaust and Memory provides a moving description of their life during the war and the sense they made of it.

In a sharp departure from the past, many Poles are expressing a deep, sympathetic interest in the phenomenon of emerging Jews by flocking to Jewish museums and cultural festivals.

One of the greatest challenges faced by the international community was the fate of the refugees, those people who for various reasons could not or did not want to return to their pre-war homeland. An especially significant place within this category was taken by the Holocaust survivors \\\\u2013 the last remnants of the ten million strong pre-war Eastern and Central European Jewish community. The relief effort undertaken in helping this group, by mid-1947 numbering around 250,000 people, was a task of unprecedented scale and difficulty. Among the challenges of that time, the education of children and adolescents was of particular importance. Military authorities, non-governmental organizations (both Jewish and non-Jewish) and finally the survivors, all devoted themselves to helping those who lost their childhood and youth in concentration camps, forced labour and in hiding. This article will discuss this issue through the case-study of the Organization for Rehabilitation and Training (ORT) and its undertakings among Jewish refugees in Great Britain. ORT was set up in Russia in St. Petersburg in 1880 as the Society for the Promotion of Trades and Agriculture among the Jews in Russia, a philanthropic organization designed to assist Jewish artisans, workers and cooperatives, by providing them with cheap credit and establishing vocational schools.1 After World War I, ORT expanded into Eastern Central Europe, France and Germany and by the mid-1930s, despite growing anti-Jewish legislations, organized a comprehensive network of trade schools responding to the needs of the Jewish community. The British branch of ORT, set up in 1921, focused for the first years of its existence on fundraising and propaganda. This situation changed abruptly on 29 August 1939, two days before the outbreak of World War II as 104 teenage students and seven teachers from the ORT school in Berlin left Charlottenburg Station on a train heading for London. The school in Berlin (Private j\\\\u00fcdische Lehranstalt f\\\\u00fcr handwerkliche und gewerbliche Ausbildung auswanderungswilliger Juden der ORT Berlin), located at Siemensstrasse 15, was one of ORT\\\\u2019s most significant undertakings in the interwar period and a major centre offering vocational training to Jewish youth.2 The school was opened in 1937 as an answer to * Awarded her PhD in history at Royal Holloway, University of London in 2010.

Under the protection of the British Government the school remained the only Jewish institution which functioned unaffected by the Kristallnacht, and indeed by late 1938 had enrolled 215 students, offering 3-year courses to adolescents aged 15 to 17 and 18-month training courses to adult students. Yet with the persecution intensifying and the spectre of war looming on the horizon, the leadership of the school decided to ensure the safety of the students by relocating to Great Britain. After negotiations with the British Ministry for Labour and the Home Office, as well as the Gestapo, it was agreed to move the school, together with all its equipment, to Leeds. The transfer, carried out by Colonel J.H. Levey of British ORT, was prepared by ORT together with OSE (Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants \\\\u2013 the Organization to Save the Children). As already mentioned, the first group of students (without the equipment, which at the last moment was confiscated by the Nazis) left Berlin on 29 August. The second group, headed by the director of the school, Werner Simon, was scheduled to leave on 3 September 1939. Neither Simon, nor the boys, ever made it out of Berlin. Almost all of them were later murdered in the Holocaust. The 104 teenage boys who reached London on the outbreak of the war could not have anticipated the fate that awaited their families left behind in Germany. Most of those who were in the transport recalled their relocation as a great adventure. It is clear however that parents saying their goodbyes at the station and those who welcomed them in Great Britain were fully aware of the gravity of the situation and, as one of the boys remembered, the group was met in London by weeping Jewish women from the East End.4 As the school in Leeds was not yet prepared for their reception, the boys and their teachers were first accommodated in the Kitchener reception camp at Sandwich, Kent, which housed about 4,000 German and Austrian refugees. Already in November, however, the first group was transferred to Leeds. ORT\\\\u2019s leaflet \\\\u2018From Despair to Hope: A Constructive Form of Help\\\\u2019, devoted to the work of the Technical Engineering School in Leeds, recalled its beginnings: A technical school should first be planned and then constructed. In the case of the ORT school there was no time, no money, and no material available for such a project. After a long and arduous search, the most suitable building that could be found, with a floor area of about 12,000 square feet, was rented. It is situated about a mile from the residential hostels. Tools, equipment, and machinery were purchased, and the students, under the guidance of the instructors (all from Berlin), installed the machinery, connected it with the electric power supply, and made all fittings possible in the workshop of the school. The students of the plumbing and sanitary section of the school erected lavatories, wash-houses etc., and within a short time the school was at work.5 Britain: The Yearbook of the Research Centre for German and Austrian Exile Studies 2 (Amsterdam; Atlanta, G.A.: Rodopi, 2000), 82\\\\u201383. 3 For more on this, see Solomon Colodner, Jewish Education in Germany under the Nazis (New York: Jewish Education Committee Press, 1964). 4 World ORT Archive (WOA) D04a010, Hans W.

It was divided into five departments: (1) Welding, Turning and Fitting, (2) Sanitary Engineering, (3) Electrical Engineering, (4) Mechanical Engineering, (5) Carpentry and Joinery. There was also a market-gardening section, which organized six-month courses under the supervision of an agricultural director from Palestine. All lessons in school were to be conducted in English, even though, as one of the students remarked on leaving the school, \\\\u2018as the Masters are really too busy and old, they cannot be expected to pick up the language as easily as young people.\\\\u20196 One day of the five day school week was allotted to theoretical classes in mathematics and science. More advanced students also attended classes in the Leeds School of Technology. Students who arrived from Berlin, referred to as the \\\\u2018old boys\\\\u2019, continued the studies which they had begun in Germany, but in time the school also began admitting new students, both girls and boys, aged fifteen to eighteen. These were mainly teenage refugees from Eastern and Central Europe who arrived as part of the Kindertransport.7 The majority of students resided in one of five hostels in the school vicinity, each housing 25 to 30 students and staff members of the school. In charge of each hostel was a hostel master responsible for the discipline and conduct of the students. There were two to six students in each room sleeping on bunk beds, with a room leader responsible for rules and regulations being carried out. The school was run by its director, Colonel Levey, with military precision. Students woke up at 6.00 am (6.30 in the winter), and classes lasted from 8.30 am till 12.30 pm and again from 1.30 pm till 4.00 pm. All students had to be back in their rooms by 10.00 pm. Most equipment in the school was constructed by the students, who also did all the redecoration in the building and took turns cleaning the school premises on Sunday mornings.8 The school had a decidedly Jewish character. It was closed on all Jewish holidays and on Sabbath and all food served was strictly kosher. However, as the ORT booklet made clear, the institution was \\\\u2018a Technical School and not a religious educational establishment\\\\u20199 and students were free to carry out whatever religious observance they wished. Attendance in the synagogue was not compulsory and while students were able to participate in Jewish education classes, these were also not compulsory. There was no religious instruction held in the hostels.10 At the same time, the small group of Orthodox students from among the school community was given full support in religious observance and allowed to build a small synagogue on the school\\\\u2019s premises.11 There is no doubt that the leadership of the school placed great importance on the wellbeing of the students.

This article is based on group interviews conducted with Holocaust survivors living in Sydney, Australia and explores how these Holocaust survivors would like the Holocaust to be remembered in the future. From the discussion groups it was clear that most of these survivors are unsure if the next generation possesses the inclination and ability not only to remember the Holocaust, but to remember it well. There was a clear sentiment amongst all the groups that one of the only ways the memory of the Holocaust can survive is by being cast as a religious act, duty and obligation, to be codified in the Jewish religious calendar.\", \"year\": 2007}, {\"paperId\": \"bd7e78356ce0386078991bb55886f7d59b5fdf58\", \"title\": \"Guerrilla War in the Mountains: Experiences of Jewish Fighters in the Slovak National Uprising and Partisan Resistance\", \"abstract\": \"ABSTRACT This article aims to bring forward first-person life stories and reflections of \\\\u201cordinary\\\\u201d Jewish Holocaust survivors who took part in the Slovak resistance during World War II.

As the survivors from Tarnow and Piotrokow attest, ghetto residents formed strong dyadic social bonds that functioned to guarantee physical and emotional survival. By extending this initial analysis through comparison with Lachwa, one of the few ghettos that saw collective resistance, we can observe how individual survival mechanisms interacted with leadership and community variables. The Jews of Lachwa pursued strategies similar to those seen in Tarnow and Piotrokow. The unique variable at Lachwa which led to broad-based resistance was the structural advantage of a small, easily manageable village which facilitated the transition from individual survival strategies to collective action at a crucial moment.\", \"year\": 2010}, {\"paperId\": \"be5cb1eb72d26c8705dd7ba05a0e988074992135\", \"title\": \"CHILDREN AND WAR ~ The Children Accuse ( Poland , 1946 ) : Between Exclusion from and Inclusion into the Holocaust Canon\", \"abstract\": \"In 1946 the Jewish Historical Commission in Cracow published the first collection of the early postwar testimonies of Jewish children in Poland Dzieci Oskarzaja (The Children Accuse).[1] The book consists of fifty-five children\\\\u2019s testimonies and fifteen adult testimonies.

As his left-leaning political idealism faded, he withdrew from the Parlisan Review crowd, beginning his move toward the entrenched conservatism he is now either vilified or praised for. His goal was not only to make his mark on American letters, but to make it in the international arena as well. His two abiding goals were to mount a passionate defense of the human creature and simultaneously supplant the monumental, skeptical, modernist naysayer Ernest Hemingway. He rode into American literary history on the tidal wave of the \\\\\"Jewish Decades,\\\\\" the 1950s, which breached forever the WASP hegemony in American letters. Along with his cadre, he was greeted with a pejorative designation: \\\\\"Jewish-American ethnic writer,\\\\\" not \\\\\"American writer.\\\\\" Already disaffiliated from his Jewishness by his unhappy family life, he further disaffiliated himself from this parochial put-down. Perhaps he even wondered if writing about the Holocaust, still a \\\\\"Jewish\\\\\" topic in the minds of many, might further \\\\\"ethnicize\\\\\" him in the eyes of the international literary community. Bellow\\'s subsequent mea culpas for his early disaffiliation from Judaism and for his failure to write about the Holocaust sooner are now a matter of historical record. These admissions lie scattered throughout his post-1970s essays, lectures, interviews, family conversations, and fiction, which, taken together, represent a genuine atonement. The spiritual integrity of this process was such that it precluded his offering further explanations. In this essay, I want to historicize, complicate, and dignify the issue of Bellow\\'s writerly delay by examining the atmosphere that prevailed during the immediate post-Holocaust decades of Bellow\\'s 1940s and \\'50s literary debut and by revisiting Bellow\\'s own psychological and metaphysical journey. From the vantage point of the 1960s, many commentators accused American Jews of having been impotent in the face of National Socialism, ground down by the trenchantly anti-Semitic Roosevelt-State-Department America, lacking in social cohesion, and generally too comfortable in the suburbs. Other commentators accused American Jews of religious disunity, stunned disbelief, and undue discouragement over the failure of the 1938 Evian conference to facilitate Jewish refugees. Nativism flourished--even Chinese immigrants, previously denied any rights to citizenship, were now more desirable American citizens than Jews. Organized boycotts of German goods, people argued, were too little too late. Even the Zionist movement stood accused of weak leadership and fracturing from within. Judaic humanism, now thought by some to have been overly idealist in the face of the Holocaust, could not guarantee a rational future for Jews after Auschwitz. From the vantage point of the 1960s, Leon Jick wrote his influential essay \\\\\"The Holocaust--Its Uses and Abuses in the American Public,\\\\\" claiming that \\\\\"American Jewry sought to forget,\\\\\" and had rendered the Holocaust a \\\\\"barely remembered, rarely mentioned event, of interest only to survivors\\\\\" (308-09). Edward Shapiro in A Time for Healing: American Jewry since World War II, reported that \\\\\"there was relatively little discussion among American Jews about the fate of European Jewry\\\\\" (5), and Gerald Sorin claimed there had been a conspiracy of silence (217). By the 1970s, Jack Wertheimer insisted that the problem was not so much moral abdication and amnesia as the fact that \\\\\"the trauma of the Holocaust [was] buried in the American Jewish psyche [and took a very long time to] erupt into public consciousness\\\\\" (7). Edward Alexander further lamented that \\\\\"the American Jewish community was simultaneously the most powerful and powerless in the world, and that it had tragically abnegated responsibility for its brethren at the crucial moment\\\\\" (122). \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2007}, {\"paperId\": \"bf07416011610dee046b6de191fbe1160b1ba9f7\", \"title\": \"Rolf Dieter Brinkmanns Fifties.

In place of historical photographs and footage it offers present-day geography. Guided by on-screen interviews with survivors, witnesses, and perpetrators, nine and a half hours of \\\\\"traveling shots\\\\\" and \\\\\"pans\\\\\" repeatedly traverse a small number of sites: former extermination camps in Poland and their surrounds, highways in Germany, railway stations, fields and rivers where atrocities occurred or were planned. These shots replace the piles of bodies, bulldozed and filmed by liberating armies, that comprise the \\\\\"raw\\\\\" material of many other films of the Holocaust. Shoah\\'s refusal to visualize the past has inspired thoughtful reflection on the limits of representation, the problematics of witnessing, and the presence of the past through its traces in individual hearts and the industrial world.3 Some readings have also touched on the places of the past, not lieux de me\\'moire, or repositories of the past, but charged pieces of earth where the events happened.4 These places of memory constitute the \\\\\"geographe\\\\\" of Lanzmann\\'s film. These are not the only places in Shoah, however. While the images consistently refer the survivor\\'s narratives back to the places where they occurred, Lanzmann painstakingly situates most of the interviews themselves in the far-flung places where the interviewees found refuge, chiefly Israel and the United States. Furthermore, the film itself has a place of enunciation, a place from which it emanates. The literature on Shoah has devoted little attention to the places from which the survivors return to their past, and still less to the place of Shoah the film. In part this neglect may be due to the immensity of the film, its length a metaphor for the immensity of the event itself. Difficult to grasp as a whole, Shoah, like a novel, invites one to look at it piecemeal, to analyze its motifs and its characters. Yet also like a novel, Shoah has a plot, and its plot relates not only to the places of the Holocaust but also to the places of enunciation.

As a sociologist, native Belgian, and Holocaust survivor, Suzanne Vromen is perhaps the perfect person to author a study of the Jewish children hidden by Belgian nuns during the Holocaust. Drawing on detailed interviews conducted with eight nuns, one priest, twenty-nine survivors who were hidden as children, and two lay individuals who escorted the children from their families to their hiding places, she both corroborates other findings about the child victims of the Holocaust and provides new understandings of their rescuers. In the book\\\\u2019s introduction, the author tells her own story of Holocaust survival. It therefore seems appropriate to mention it at the beginning of this review as well. Along with her immediate family, Vromen fled Nazi-occupied Belgium in 1941 for what was then known as the Belgian Congo, where she attended school in a convent. As she writes of her experiences, \\\\u201cI distinctly remember my initial bewilderment at being plunged suddenly into a Catholic milieu. I also recall how I eventually made my peace with the atmosphere of spirituality and the intense socialization that characterize convents\\\\u201d (p. 1).

In fact, a detailed chapter on the nuns is presented along with equally rich chapters on the hidden children and on the lay rescuers.

Title aside, the book\\\\u2019s structure is appropriate, as Vromen\\\\u2019s analysis makes it clear that one cannot fully understand the hidden children\\\\u2019s experiences without taking into account the experiences of the nuns and the other resisters, as well as the broader institutional context in which they operated. The substantive chapters offer individual accounts that in many ways defy a simple summary. The convents in which the children were hidden differed in terms of number of children housed as well as resources available to care for them. The children\\\\u2019s experiences varied further depending on their age, gender, and whether or not they were placed with a sibling.

As we attempt to understand and remember in the post-Holocaust generation and beyond, we face the challenge of constructing ways for ensuring a continued legacy. This paper describes a creative approach for bringing students closer to the tragic event that is receding in memory \\\\u2013 bringing them closer through affective, emotional engagement with the powerful life stories of Holocaust survivors. The quote above comes from one of the students in the Santa Clara University upper-division writing course, \\\\u201cVisual Media and Holocaust Narrative.\\\\u201d We will explain the underlying pedagogy we have developed, which we believe leads to students gaining insight into the implications and meanings of the Holocaust. We will illustrate that a high level of learning is taking place and that the students\\\\u2019 work reflects a deeper than usual level of understanding and an integration of various kinds of learning. The learning is inherently active and, for most students, powerfully transformative. In Lynn E. Swaner\\\\u2019s words, \\\\u201cthey begin to question, test, and reformulate\\\\u201d their old ways of making meaning and \\\\u201ctheir views of themselves and the world in which they live\\\\u201d (18). We think this course, which uses Holocaust testimonies as an experiential teaching tool, is an effective model that others might consider adopting. Oral history video testimony is a powerful teaching resource in an increasingly audiovisual culture. It is also a stimulus for research. With its informative as well as performative properties, Holocaust video testimony engages both the intellect and emotions of the students and reveals the dignity and humanity of the interviewees. It is a compelling way to intensify the immediacy of history as it comes alive in the context of a person\\\\u2019s life. The difference lays in the detailed, in-depth story, including the emotion that is visible in the survivor\\\\u2019s voice, expression, and even the silences. These stories do not present a stereotype of a victim, but rather a survivor, often a warm grandparent figure in his or her own home, one who has an incredible story to tell. As scholars in many disciplines recognize, narrative is powerful and important. As one of our students wrote, \\\\u201cit is hard to separate oneself from Goodman, Gradowski, Saldinger IOHA 2010 2 tragedy after uncovering a lost story.\\\\u201d Reflecting the experience of many of the students, another said: \\\\u201clearning from oral history is completely different from reading a textbook.\\\\u201d Because survivors are aging, and each year fewer are able to travel and speak personally to classes, it is often their videotaped oral histories that now fulfill the mission of education and public memory. Students are often amazed by the dignity of the survivors and the calm and poised way in which they tell their stories. They are also intrigued by both the amount and the subtlety of new information they learn. One student wrote: \\\\u201cBefore I did the work in this class, I hadn\\\\u2019t viewed the communities of Jewish victims as a complex layering of actions and reactions that we normally associate with the idea of community. I just lumped them all together as human beings that were reduced to shadows of their former selves.\\\\u201d By listening closely, finding powerful passages, and identifying key motifs and locations in the oral histories, students were compelled to think deeply about the essence of one person\\\\u2019s experience and what he or she hoped to share with the world. Interestingly, students often reflected on their own families and values, which we think speaks to this very personal kind of learning and to the fact that the stories that emerge from oral history have the potential to help students recognize commonalities, bridge differences, and ensure continuity through generations. In the surveys they filled out, 100% of our students said that watching the tape gave them a \\\\u201cbetter understanding of the experience of a Holocaust survivor,\\\\u201d and 100% said they responded \\\\u201con a personal level to watching the tape.\\\\u201d Many grew fond of their subject (referring to \\\\u201cmy person\\\\u201d in class discussions), and some became passionate advocates for them. One student was especially moved when he realized that his survivor had been only 19 years old when he joined the Polish resistance, that he was \\\\u201cyounger than I am now.\\\\u201d The empathic engagement with the subject through oral history often leads to a transformative experience. As one student wrote: \\\\u201cI came out of this class immensely more aware of myself as a person. Learning about the Holocaust and hearing, reading, and watching the experiences of survivors really helped to put my life in context. . . . Often times I get caught up in the daily grind and all of the stresses of life, and I forget just how lucky I am to be healthy, safe, and loved. These are three things this class has taught me never to take for granted.\\\\u201d In a way, the students also feel entrusted with the survivor\\\\u2019s oral histories and obligated to hold their stories and pass them on. As another student wrote, \\\\u201cI feel connected to the people whose interviews I watched, and I feel like I am one of the few people who can pass on their stories \\\\u2013 even [if] just to my family and friends. I can bear witness to what they went through, even though no one can ever know exactly what it felt like. Also, I Goodman, Gradowski, Saldinger IOHA 2010 3 can remind people of specific things that happened and describe some of what the people went through \\\\u2013 when they need to remember.\\\\u201d We had a number of specific goals when we began developing this course, and it is important to note that the thinking and talking took place over many years and always in collaboration with each other and several other colleagues. Our goals were to use the oral histories more fully than we did in previous courses we had taught in order to create an opportunity for deeper learning, to enhance the experiential and community-based learning components of the course, and to fulfill the mandate of the new Santa Clara University core curriculum by adding a new media component. We also wanted to create a more sophisticated research assignment, one that demands more student engagement and cognitive complexity: higher-order thinking skills (analysis, synthesis, and creativity as well as an opportunity to teach others about what they have learned). The course focus on the intersection of film and first-hand accounts of the Holocaust appeals to undergraduates. It is grounded in the Holocaust testimonies, and the major project, the writing assignment that shapes the course, is a proposal for a documentary film based on the lives of the survivors whose oral histories the students work on. Their film can be about the survivor\\\\u2019s war experience generally, or focused more narrowly on some event or segment of his or her life. In pairs, using their oral histories as primary sources, the students decide on a focus and theme, do the research, and write the proposal. In other words, the primary material itself takes the students in various directions, and together with their partner, they must determine their own research path. To go along with their proposals, we ask the students to create a 2.5-minute promotional trailer \\\\u2013 a digital story made using multimedia resources, which we will explain later.

The ironic tone of Arendt\\'s controversial reports on the trial, Eichmann in Jerusalem (1963), her critics claim, is a mode of defence; a cold-hearted carapace of bitter reason thrown up against the atrocious history of unbearable suffering dramatised in the 62 days of harrowing witness testimony that made the 1961 Jerusalem trial unique in the history of war crime trials. As Idith Zertal has argued recently, however, it was not--or at least not only--the suffering of Holocaust survivors per se that Arendt was distancing herself from in pre-1967 Jerusalem, but the sanctification of that suffering within an emerging politics of Israeli nationhood. In Zertal\\'s unsettling history of the vexed relation between trauma, grief, collective memory and national politics in Israel, Arendt\\'s deliberate irreverence deconstructs a national mythology that did not so much deliver justice to Holocaust victims--\\'as if justice could be rendered\\', writes Zertal of Prime Minister, David Ben Gurion\\'s presentation of the Eichmann trial as an uniquely expiatory event in the history of Israel--as set extraordinarily difficult cultural and political terms on the representation of that justice itself. (2) In this essay, I want to suggest that Arendt\\'s refusal to inhabit a rhetoric of traumatic testimony--a refusal that differs so strikingly from the tone of much contemporary memoir writing--connects Eichmann in Jerusalem with her larger project to think about judgement in the 1960s and 1970s. For Arendt, the Prosecution\\'s emphasis on \\'what the Jews had suffered, not on what Eichmann had done\\', in her words, was questionable politically, but could not be further from what she thought should have been the trial\\'s main business: the risky, necessary and exhilarating legal, moral and philosophical task of defining new terms for judgement after the Shoah. (3) For Arendt, Eichmann the buffoon was the disturbingly vacuous correlative for the moral void left by Nazi history. Finding him funny was part of what it meant to judge him. If one can somehow be one\\'s own irony, as Arendt later suggested in the interview with Gunter Gaus cited above, if irony turns out to be a kind of kernel of the historical and remembering self and not merely a protective shell, it is perhaps because the ironic voice positions the subject in a distinctive relation to historical injury--not only as a suffering, but as a political, moral and, crucially in Arendt\\'s later writing on judgement, thinking witness. I GREY CATS One of the paradoxes of the Eichmann trial was that while nobody really doubted that the defendant was guilty, the guilt of others not in the glass box dominated discussion of it. From Eichmann\\'s ludicrous self-aggrandising claims that his death would serve as an example to all future anti-semites and at the same time relieve Germany\\'s youth of its guilt complex, to Ben Gurion\\'s, \\'We want the nations of the world to know [...] and they should be ashamed\\'(EinJ, p10), the trial took place in a highly-charged culture of grief and expiation in which Eichmann\\'s guilt was not only a given, but even on occasion an irrelevance. (Ben Gurion again: \\'the fate of Eichmann, the person, has no interest for me whatsoever. What is important is the spectacle\\' (IH, p107). \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2009}, {\"paperId\": \"c41614e492500722e14f4b0cee57a4704c4f044d\", \"title\": \"Vicarious Witnessing in European Concentration Camps: Imagining the Trauma of Another:\", \"abstract\": \"When standing before the historical evidence of a massive trauma such as the Holocaust, people vicariously witness the trauma through photographs, artistic images, survivor stories, and physical artifacts.

The effect of this reconstruction involves a powerful experience, whereby people believe that they know something very deeply about the event by living imaginatively through the experiences of another. This phenomenon is the vicarious witnessing experience. This qualitative research project explores the impact of vicarious witnessing during visits to concentration camps in Germany and Poland. Each participant constructed three types of narrative perspectives before, during, and after visiting the camps, including written (travel journals), spoken (interview and conversational dialogues), and visual (photography) texts. In analyzing these texts, the author utilized two types of narrative analyses, interpretive readings and narrative instances. The analysis showed how participants filtered their vicarious witnessing experience through personal, social, and cultural frameworks, created a safe vicarious witnessing experience, and made sense of their experiences through the perspective of their own lives.

Each of these collections has entailed collaborating with a partner outside the university community, as well as faculty within the university, and each has presented a different set of opportunities and challenges. The first example is a collection of videos digitized from VHS tapes, composed of interviews with survivors of the 1939-1945 Holocaust. These are being used as source materials for students, who create themed A/V essays from edited portions of the). The second example is a set of sacramental mission records spanning the 17 to the 19 centuries. This population recorded included indigenous peoples, Spanish residents, and Anglo immigrants. They are being used as source material for students doing historical research on population trends in the area. Best practice/implementation issues include intellectual property, security, digitizing, and metadata. Supporting the curriculum with digital collections Traditionally, libraries have furnished storage and organization of intellectual content, while providing public access to them. In the last couple of decades, though, this role has evolved, largely through the application of emerging technologies in networking, storage, and increasingly user-friendly discovery and retrieval interfaces (Franklin et al., 2006). Now they offer access both onsite and from remote locations, serve as preservation centers by digitizing materials, and disseminate items that they do not house themselves. This ability to organize and consolidate the discovery of materials from many locations has increased their value as centers of research. Digital libraries are a recent product of this evolution. Vannaver Bush was probably the first to predict what we now consider the digital library, in his 1945 article As We May Think, but it wasn\\'t until the 1990s, with the rise of the Internet and the graphical World Wide Web, that serious practical applications of digital libraries developed. The Library of Congress\\'s American Memory (Mission and History, 2009) is an early example of the evolving ability to create a digital library of primary source material. In California, our local consolidation of source items is called Calisphere, a production of the University of California. This service draws content from many venues throughout the state, and is organized to serve K-12 educators, with themed collections, sample lesson plans, and links to further resources (Calisphere, n.d.). While many digital libraries collect and present items of interest to educators, there are ways to expand the usefulness of such libraries. In an AACE symposium in 2006, Franklin et al. discussed how technological support was making it more feasible to provide primary materials for classroom use (Franklin et al., 2006). This presentation will offer examples of how Santa Clara University Library has begun to add this role to its mission. Library/Faculty partnerships Academic libraries have a long history of partnering with faculty in such areas as material selection, information literacy teaching, and topic-focused research training modules. SCU Library, through its Digital Initiatives Department, has begun a different sort of partnering: constructing custom digital collections of digitized primary source materials for course use. Santa Clara is considered as primarily a teaching university, so while the Library has an ongoing commitment to the digital preservation of its archival and special collections materials, it also understands the need to support the teaching mission of the school. Two examples of this support, each with a unique set of opportunities and challenges, are the Holocaust Oral History Project and the Mission Santa Clara Sacramental Records.\", \"year\": 2009}, {\"paperId\": \"c4a61d1c817024d27ea2780c41f7896270bc2597\", \"title\": \"A Jewish Family in Germany Today: An Intimate Portrait\", \"abstract\": \"Immediately after the Holocaust, it seemed inconceivable that a Jewish community would rebuild in Germany.

This issue is also compelling as the articles use oral history not only to interrogate the past but also to contemplate contemporary events in the United States and around the world. War and its aftermath is certainly a reality of life in the twenty-first century, and two articles address larger questions of survival, interrogating what that means for veterans and civilians alike. We begin the issue with Alistair Thomson\\\\u2019s \\\\u201cAnzac Memories Revisited,\\\\u201d an article in which Thomson returns to interviews he conducted 30 years ago with an Australian World War One veteran. This insightful article, which draws on these interviews in light of new questions and interpretations since the publication of Thomson\\\\u2019s book Anzac Memories, foregrounds questions of individual and collective memory of war and postwar life, especially trauma and its aftermath.

In doing so, he moves beyond obvious ways that narrators recount events through where they physically were in any particular point in time; instead, he suggests that memory allows narrators to employ \\\\u201cstrategies of memory\\\\u201d that allow them to navigate the retelling of painful and difficult events in their lives, especially around separation from family and physical or mental violence. Strategic memory is not limited, of course, to wartime survivors. Jennifer Helgren interrogates oral history narratives of a multiracial group of women who grew up in the 1950s and 1960s. How women construct nostalgic recollections of a \\\\u201cvery innocent time\\\\u201d when girls participated in single-sex organizations and grew up in more insular communities illuminates gendered notions of safety and respectability, concepts the women in Helgren\\\\u2019s study worked hard to maintain in their lives.

Method: Old (age \\\\u226480) and old-old (age >80) participants who were identified as Holocaust survivors (n = 225), and comparison of pre-war (n = 103) and post-war (n = 254) European-descent immigrants referred to their past in a biographical interview.

Results: The findings suggest that even after massive trauma and under accelerating decline associated with old-old age, the past can keep life pleasant, as indicated by the stronger association of past happiness, compared to that of past suffering, with life satisfaction. Nevertheless, past suffering was associated with life satisfaction among the Holocaust survivors and manifested a stronger effect among most of the old-old participants.

It examines the experience of sexual violence, as well as the ways this can be understood through the Visual History Archive. I argue that Jewish women were vulnerable to and experienced sexual violence during the Holocaust in different ways depending on the context in which they found themselves. In this thesis, I explore five of these contexts: the initial Nazi occupation period, in ghettos, in the Nazi camp system, in hiding and during flight, and immediately following the liberation. The thesis begins with a theoretical and methodological consideration of the testimonies and how stories of sexual violence are shaped within the interview. In this section, I firstly consider the Visual History Archive, and the ways that the interviews, the interviewers and the systems of the VHA itself have potentially impacted upon and shaped the English-language interviews that discuss sexual violence. I argue that the origins and conceptual framework of the project, and the ways that the interviews were conducted have an impact on how survivors reveal and discuss issues of sexual violence, as well as on the ability of researchers to investigate sexual violence using this archive. Secondly, I consider the way survivors reflect on their decisions to speak about sexual violence. Survivors often discuss remaining silent, or feeling silenced, about their experiences of sexual violence. In the fifty years between the end of the Holocaust and the recording of the interviews, survivors have been thinking about and attempting to make sense of their memories of sexual violence and how it fits within their Holocaust experience and their life story. The way survivors have interpreted and reinterpreted their experiences of sexual violence influences how they tell these stories in their interviews with the Shoah Foundation. In the remainder of the thesis, I analyse the Visual History Archive\\\\u2019s 989 English-language testimonies that discuss sexual violence and explore five specific contexts of vulnerability in detail. In each context, I identify specific patterns within the interview data, including perpetrators, types of abuse and specific geographic location, and consider how Jewish women were vulnerable in different ways at different points in time and in different contexts of the Holocaust. I also consider factors which potentially influenced the vulnerability of Jewish women, such as anti-Jewish legislation, Nazi laws prohibiting sexual relations between so-called \\\\u2018Aryans\\\\u2019 and Jews, and rules and hierarchies within the military and the camp systems that dealt effectively or ineffectively with sexual violence.

In sum, in this thesis I examine survivors\\\\u2019 English-language narratives about sexual violence, and how these memories inform historians about the vulnerability of Jewish women and female children during the Holocaust.

Data from in-depth interviews were grouped into four themes that were common to all the participants; when and how the participants learned about the Holocaust, the effect of this legacy on their personal development during childhood, the impact of the legacy on the participants\\' chosen professions or work in the world, and the participants\\' current values and thoughts on spiritual and social issues. Thematic analysis of each category further defined the experience of the participants and offered a data base for emerging implications. The implications include: the need for further study of the effects of war and genocide on the second generation, the need for greater education, and the inclusion of the second generation in treatment of psychological trauma, the need to provide opportunities for the descendants of both sides to speak and have their stories heard in a safe and non-judgmental environment, and the greater concern about the long-term psychological damage of wars, genocide, and group violence on future\", \"year\": 1996}, {\"paperId\": \"cac1c387a37f5812b3e083de2b90f7baf8cb5ae1\", \"title\": \"extensively from Nazi potentates and officials, not all of his claims are firmly grounded in empirical evidence, as sometimes he has chosen to extrapolate selectively from fragmentary evidence regarding actual cash flows.*\", \"abstract\": \"\\\\ufffd\\\\ufffd\\\\ufffd The case of Scherwitz is \\\\u201cextraordinary,\\\\u201d writes Anita Kugler in this fascinating biographical study of the life and times of Fritz Scherwitz, a police and SS official in occupied Latvia who presented himself after the war as a Jewish survivor of the Riga concentration camp.

Degree of presence of Holocaust in the family was examined in families in which both parents were HSO, either mother or father was HSO, and neither parent was HSO. Mothers\\' Holocaust background was associated with higher levels of psychological distress and less positive parenting representations. In line with synergic (multiplicative) models of risk, adolescents in families where both parents were HSO perceived their mothers as less accepting and less encouraging independence, and reported less positive self-perceptions than their counterparts. They also perceived their fathers as less accepting and less encouraging independence, showed higher levels of ambivalent attachment style, and according to their peers, demonstrated poorer adjustment during military basic training than their fellow recruits from the one-parent HSO group. Parents and adolescents in the one-parent HSO group functioned similarly to others with no Holocaust background. Parenting variables mediated the association across generations between degree of Holocaust experience in the family of origin of the parents and ambivalent attachment style and self-perception of the adolescents. It is recommended that researchers and clinicians develop awareness of the possible traces of trauma in the second and the third generation despite their sound functioning in their daily lives.Thanks to the families that participated in this study for their willingness to contribute their time and experience and for sharing with us some of their most precious moments.

New York: Oxford University Press, 2009. 211 pages. Cloth, $74.00. Given that Holocaust survivors\\' stories have been commemorated in novels, plays, and motion pictures, the title of this book may seem, at face value, very familiar. But Approaching an Auschwitz Survivor adopts a distinctive tone and approach in providing narratives about the journey to concentration camps, unbearable camp lives, and death marches. The editor, Jurgen Matthaus, together with four other Holocaust scholars-Konrad Kwiet, Nechama Tec, Atina Grossman, and Wendy Lower--devote their analyses to the testimony of one Holocaust survivor, Helen \\\\\"Zippi\\' Tichauer (nee Spitzer). Zippi, as she preferred to be called, was born 1918 in Bratislava and was one of the first 2,000 young, unmarried Jewish women transported to Auschwitz in March 1942 from Slovakia. Spending two and a half years in the camp, she was not only one of the few early arrivals to survive the camp and the death marches, but also still able, through her testimony, to remember crucial aspects of daily camp life. Based on her experience, she is uniquely qualified, even obligated, to bear witness to the horrors of Auschwitz. The book comprises five chapters, each written by one of the five contributing historians, and a conclusion. In the first chapter, \\\\\"Designing Survival: A Graphic Artist in Birknau,\\\\\" Kwiet examines perhaps the most important aspect of Zippi\\'s testimony. With her proficiency in German and educational training in graphic design, she was entrusted with the registration of new arrivals and the labeling of uniforms of inmates. Nazi officials used the colored triangle (Winkel) on the uniforms of new arrivals as an effective device in all concentration camps to monitor and control the prisoners by creating a hierarchy and divisions among the inmates. Nazi designated color-coding indicates \\\\\"red for political prisoners, green for \\'criminals,\\' purple for Jehovah\\'s Witnesses, black for prostitutes and other social outcasts, black or brown for Sinti and Roma, blue for \\'emigrants\\'\\\\\" (p. 17). Although camp life for the rank and file was humiliating, dehumanizing, and even deadly, Zippi was lucky to belong to the camp elite; she never wore an armband and was privileged to receive preferential treatment in terms of better dress, food, and housing. In \\\\\"Recapturing the Past: Individuality and Cooperation in Auschwitz\\\\\" (Chapter 2), Tec explores the wartime history of Zippi, highlighting her childhood, life for Jews in German-occupied Slovakia, and her ability to navigate a delicate balance in Auschwitz-Birknau between submission to SS orders and her offers to help various resistance groups and/or individuals. Although Zippi denies being a resister, her history and testimony indicates a close connection to individuals who belonged to resistance groups. In \\\\\"Displacing Memory\\\\\" (Chapter 3), Matthaus analyzes Zippi\\'s first documented account of her wartime life story, based on a 1946 interview in a Displaced Persons (DP) camp in Feldafing, Germany, she granted David Boder, a psychology professor at the Illinois Institute of Technology. Boder\\'s interview was part of a project designed to record the wartime memories of DPs. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2010}, {\"paperId\": \"cdbb8957517a53a8f2dfab395b36f1930d2c026a\", \"title\": \"Book review: The liberation of the camps: the end of the Holocaust and its aftermath by Dan Stone\", \"abstract\": \"In The Liberation of the Camps: The End of the Holocaust and its Aftermath, Dan Stone explores the deconstruction of the Nazi camp network.

Meaning-making theorists, however, have suggested that people who have suffered severe, direct traumas may be the most likely to search for meaning but the least likely to find it. This unfortunate conclusion is based on empirical studies that have narrowly construed meaning making as \\\\u201cmaking sense\\\\u201d or \\\\u201cfinding benefit\\\\u201d and that have limited their investigations to examining cognitive systems of appraisal. Armour found that family survivors of homicide victims employed other meaning-making processes and documented how activity or the intentional engagement in behaviors designed to focus explicitly on the things that matter most after trauma is often a part of the meaning making of those for whom cognitive processes alone prove less than healing. This mixed-methods study applies Armour\\'s own theory of meaning making grounded in action to a historic and mass trauma by examining how 133 Holocaust survivors pursued what mattered at three different time points: during the Holocaust, after they immigrated to the United States, and as older adults. Content analysis of audiotaped interviews found that survival expressed through actions and attitudes was the core theme at all three time points. During the Nazi regime, survivors kept themselves alive physically by refusing to consider the option of death, being lucky, outwitting the Nazis, stealing, and following a strict philosophy of independence or collectivism. They kept hope alive through believing in liberation, attaching to personal fantasies of what the future might hold, and remaining loyal to loved ones and having faith in their reunion. After immigration, survivors focused on survival by striving for education and family; having children; being successful; shutting the door to the past; and cultivating proactive attitudes such as gratitude, acceptance, and the dissolving of hatred. As older adults, survivors\\' concerns with survival are expressed through maintaining their health, fulfilling their obligations to those who died, and taking principled stands to fight hatred and oppression.\", \"year\": 2010}, {\"paperId\": \"cdd93c16539aa52fde78c48292664ff4c68a2680\", \"title\": \"Evaluation Findings of a Community-Based Intervention for Older Adults With a History of Trauma\", \"abstract\": \"Abstract Between 70% and 90% of Americans aged 65 and older have experienced at least one traumatic event such as a sexual or physical assault, disaster, illness, or terrorism. Trauma exposure in older adult populations is linked to physical, mental, and cognitive decline. A new approach to improve outcomes of trauma-affected older adults is Person-Centered, Trauma-Informed (PCTI) Care, which promotes the dignity, strength, and empowerment of trauma-affected individuals by incorporating knowledge about trauma into agency programs, policies, and procedures. The Administration for Community Living/Administration on Aging has awarded The Jewish Federations of North America (JFNA) a grant to develop innovative PCTI interventions for Holocaust survivors. This includes a community-based intervention whereby local leadership councils are developed to identify Holocaust survivor needs, distribute grant funding, train caregivers in PCTI care, and forge partnerships to advance community-led Holocaust survivor care. This program has been implemented in eight major US cities where 168 community leaders dispersed 25 grants serving approximately 500 Holocaust survivors. JFNA conducted an evaluation of the first six of the eight cities to determine the impact of this community-based model on participants and Holocaust survivors and investigate the process by which a community-based model can be replicated. This evaluation used surveys and semi-structured interviews to collect data on variables including understanding of PCTI care, awareness of Holocaust survivor needs, strength of community partnerships, and leadership council sustainability. This session will review evaluation findings including best practices for community-based models of PCTI care, and applicability of findings to other older populations.\", \"year\": 2020}, {\"paperId\": \"ce4f8266900abe97c22cbe7f04d01bb3ec878750\", \"title\": \"A Close Look at Holocaust Testimonies: Ngram-based Content Indexing of Survivor Interviews\", \"abstract\": null, \"year\": 2021}, {\"paperId\": \"ce85c863592978057f8d4ce9a081f6e157f1b1d3\", \"title\": \"The Effects of the Holocaust: Psychiatric, Behavioral, and Survivor Perspectives\", \"abstract\": \"In this paper the authors review perspectives related to Holocaust victims, limitations of Holocaust studies are discussed, and suggestions for viewing the long-range post-traumatic effects of the Holocaust upon its victims from social and behavioral science perspectives are advanced.

Not only have non-art historians become more comfortable in using photographs in their lectures, but photographs as evidence have also proliferated well beyond the confines of photographic histories. Much of this scholarship has built on the foundational work in the late 1990s by scholars such as Marianne Hirsch as well as the contributions that played out in the pages of the journal Fotogeschichte. In addition, scholars have been aided by access to huge online photographic archives (such as that of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum) as well as the exhibition of new or under-utilised sources. From the famed debates on photographs in the Wehrmacht exhibition (Hamburg 1995) to the more recent interest in the suddenly discovered photograph album of Auschwitz-Birkenau from the SS officer Karl Hoecker, photography has become an interdisciplinary source for explorations of the history, memory, and cultural analysis of the Nazi era. The richness of new visual material can be exemplified by the Museum of Contemporary Art in Krakow\\\\u2019s catalogue on the photography of Wilhelm Brasse, recently translated into English as Wilhelm Brasse, Photographer 3444 by William Brand. Brasse was a non-Jewish Polish national who survived in Auschwitz by working for the Identification Service (Erkennungsdienst) of the SS, taking photographs of inmates but also of the SS. The majority of this catalogue is a first-person biography culled from 2010 interviews with the editor, Maria Anna Potocka. While roughly chronological, the narrative follows the pattern of many testimonies in that it jumps around, emphasises traumatic incidents of cruelty (naming the perpetrators when possible), and highlights specific moments in the history of the camp. That said, Brasse\\\\u2019s story is extraordinary in that it is one of the few of a survivor that covers almost the entire history of the camp and, in addition, it foregrounds the surprising way in which photography became a working part of the camp. From the documentation of incoming inmates to the portrait work for the SS that helped him survive, Brasse tells a blunt tale of how the dual function of photography as cultural and documentary tool integrated into a world of cruelty for the SS. At the same time, it also provided possibilities of survival for inmates. Photographic work was highly privileged labour, guaranteeing much better conditions than most forced labour at the camp. In addition, Brasse\\\\u2019s story shows how the photographic studio became a social network connecting many infamous personalities in the camp (such as Josef Mengele). And yet, this same function as a place where various peoples connected also meant that the studio could be used to establish important links with inmates\\\\u2019 groups that gave some a chance to survive. Coupled with examples of Brasse\\\\u2019s official and unofficial work, the catalogue models how this new biographical and visual evidence can help extend important debates about survival and memory in the study of the Holocaust. Frances Guerin, a film studies specialist, has also ventured into this debate with Through Amateur Eyes, a book that analyses complex examples of banal photographs and home movies during the period. Her use and interpretation of these sources is a welcome reminder to the non-visual culture specialists about the importance of close looking and attending to the representational conventions specific to this medium. The book makes a strong contribution to the field that implicitly critiques those scholars who would see amateur photography (or, by extension, any visual representation) as transparent to a historically monolithic position. For Guerin, images \\\\u2013 including the most mundane \\\\u2013 function on many different levels, from the indexical to the aesthetic to the memorial. She insists on teasing out the varied ways that a photograph can be interpreted and in so doing complicates our understanding of everyday life in National Socialist Germany as well as its relationship to the most brutal politics and ideological agenda of the state. The volume is thus a powerful reminder of how photographs work as evidence and what they contribute to a more nuanced approach to the Nazi period. Through Amateur Eyes tackles this subject in five substantive chapters that work through a range of photographic sources. Throughout, Guerin is particularly interested in the way that perpetrator and bystander images both reveal aspects of a Nazi ideological position but also refuse being reduced to a static ideology due to the ruptures, edges,\", \"year\": 2014}, {\"paperId\": \"d138e4953f5a7bfe12942fff3274c1ad84220cfb\", \"title\": \"Cultural translation in the context of glocalization\", \"abstract\": \"Recently, studies of trauma have drawn attention to the status of language as a form of representation in the face of overwhelming experiences. Responses to the issue of narrative representation, particularly the capacity of language to represent traumatic events, are polarized, however. Two parallel yet contradictory contentions regarding the efficaciousness of language and narrative as modes of representation have emerged. On the one hand, scholars such as psychologist and social critic Judith Herman argue in favour of the power of language and narrative, particularly the model of storytelling that we commonly refer to, following psychoanalysis, as the \\\\\"talking cure.\\\\\" Although the process of representing trauma is often demanding, Herman argues that language or the act of telling the trauma story as a \\\\\"talking cure\\\\\" has the capacity to render the elusive traumatic event, an act of representation that ultimately has therapeutic benefits, offering \\\\\"relief of many of the major symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder\\\\\" (183). From another perspective, Dori Laub, a psychoanalyst who works with Holocaust survivors, and literary critics, such as Shoshana Felman and Cathy Caruth, consistently draw attention to the limitations of language and storytelling. Trauma is defined by these critics as an overwhelming occurrence that is so complete, literal, and pure it demands a vocabulary and syntax incommensurable with what went before it. As Laub puts it, \\\\\"there are never enough words or the right words [...] the story [...] cannot be fully captured in thought, memory, and speech\\\\\" (63). Dominick LaCapra, however, has recently noted the dangers of this approach, arguing that it has engendered a \\\\\"psychoanalytically based fatalism\\\\\" (151) in current theories, where \\\\\"mourning itself may always seem fatalistically to come back to an endless melancholy\\\\\" (151). This critical perspective, LaCapra posits, \\\\\"eliminate [s] possibilities of working through\\\\\" the traumatic event, or fails to \\\\\"provide much insight into them\\\\\" (150). What exists, then, is a critical impasse that addresses not only the subject of language but also, as Laub describes it, storytelling, particularly in the form of talk therapy. Storytelling is situated as both powerful and redundant: it can give representation to an incomprehensible event and engender cure, while it simultaneously threatens to collapse under the strain of a traumatic episode. In effect, storytelling disallows even the prospect of working through trauma to promote psychic healing. The impasse described here is not only apparent in theoretical works on trauma; it is also evident in contemporary fiction that deals with issues of trauma, srorytelling, and representation. It is a preoccupation particularly shared by Canadian author Michael Ondaatje. He has indirectly suggested his interest in these issues in an interview with Eleanor Wachtel, where he reveals that the subject of healing is a central concern in his second novel, The English Patient. \\\\\"It is a book about very tentative healing among a group of people. I think it is that most of ail\\\\\" (255-56). Ondaatje is not taking on the role of physician or even psychotherapist here; rather, I believe his interest in healing is decidedly literary. Specifically, both The English Patient and its antecedent, In the Skin of a Lion, explore the issue of traumatic recovery in concert with an investigation of storytelling in the form of the \\\\\"talking cure.\\\\\" Like current theorists of trauma, Ondaatje explores the capacity of storytelling during talk therapy to represent and, by extension, reconcile trauma. Unlike the medical discourses that often influence discussions of trauma and narrative, however, reconciliation for Ondaatje has less to do with clinical efficacy than with broader aesthetic, political, and cultural issues, such as representation, humanism, and identity politics. If Ondaatje is interested in \\\\\"healing\\\\\" and, by extension, the capacity of storytelling to heal by representing trauma, he is implicitly implicated in the previously discussed debate that characterizes current thinking on traumatic representation. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2009}, {\"paperId\": \"d14d356f28d8352d250666a5e92d064505c56ce1\", \"title\": \"Retraumatization of Holocaust survivors during the Gulf War and SCUD missile attacks on Israel.\", \"abstract\": \"The purpose of this work was to study the reaction to a new threat and a new trauma of people severely traumatized in the past, when the new trauma had associations with the original one caused by the Holocaust.

Echoes avoids synopses of Levi\\\\u2019s works, and there is no attempt to determine the veracity of events he recounted, as can be found in biographies like The Double Bond by Carole Angier (2002) or Primo Levi: A Life by Ian Thomson (2014). Additionally, there is little on his personal life or family. Instead, Echoes\\\\u2019 purpose is assembling decades of interviews and extra-literary work into a single volume for readers who may not know of their existence or have access to them. Poli and Calcagno focus on Levi as an author and public intellectual, and long passages are direct quotes. Chapter 1, \\\\u201cThe Centaur,\\\\u201d focuses on If this is a man and Levi\\\\u2019s emergence as a writer. Chapter 2, \\\\u201cA New Incarnation,\\\\u201d examines The Truce, but also Levi\\\\u2019s fears, doubts, and hopes for the play based on his Holocaust memoir (the authors contend that Levi was still resolving survivor versus writer identity issues). Chapter 3, \\\\u201cThe Welding,\\\\u201d looks at The Periodic Table and Levi as an \\\\u201cauthor of memory,\\\\u201d but it also depicts Levi\\\\u2019s visits to schools to talk about Auschwitz. The very short chapter 4, \\\\u201cPoetry, a Strange Infection,\\\\u201d treats Levi\\\\u2019s verse, which he had been writing starting in 1943, showing that he had a strong urge to write before his Holocaust memoir. Chapter 5 \\\\u201cFrom the Lab to the Writing Desk,\\\\u201d concerns Levi\\\\u2019s short stories and talks presented throughout Italy, also discussing his theories about writing and his reflections on the Italian literary scene and the poetics of the time. In chapter 6, \\\\u201cHoliday Interlude,\\\\u201d we discover the role Levi played in the films and recordings based on his works. Chapter 7, \\\\u201cThe Watershed,\\\\u201d portrays Levi\\\\u2019s experience writing The Monkey Wrench, affording the reader insight into his feelings regarding his home city of Turin, the Piedmontese dialect, and the importance of labor. Chapter 8, \\\\u201cIf We Keep Silent, Who Will Speak?,\\\\u201d documents Levi\\\\u2019s visit to Auschwitz at a time when Holocaust denial was rearing its head. In chapter 9, \\\\u201cGiving and Having,\\\\u201d the authors delve more deeply into issues of identity, the importance of work, and thoughts on writing with specific reference to his compilation of The Search for Roots. In chapter 10, \\\\u201cA Happy Creature,\\\\u201d the writing of If Not Now, When? takes center stage and we learn of the freedom Levi felt writing his first non-autobiographical novel. Chapter 11, \\\\u201cJewishness,\\\\u201d examines Levi\\\\u2019s perception of his own Jewishness as well as his attitudes toward Israel. Chapter 12, \\\\u201cField Invasions,\\\\u201d presents Levi\\\\u2019s acceptance of the fact that writing was now his work, depicting the period around the creation of The Drowned and the Saved. Finally, chapter 13, \\\\u201cThe Circle Closes,\\\\u201d discusses some of the final words Levi penned before his suicide, addressing such matters as the notion of a collective voice in remembrance, the idea of forgiveness and repentance, and the need for a Hippocratic Oath for scientists. This organization of chapters chronologically by literary work provides an opportunity to compare Levi\\\\u2019s thoughts through time, since some of the same topics surface repeatedly.

It should not be limited to just one day a year, nor should it be restricted to just one group of people, or certain institutions. Smaller-scale commemoration can be just as insightand impactful as official talks, or the curated work found in large, dedicated museums. Over the past five years I have been lucky enough to experience a very personal and emotive form of commemoration in the form and shape of traditional storytelling. I first met Shonaleigh in July 2013 when I was hosting an international conference on Holocaust commemoration in contemporary culture at the University of Portsmouth, and Shonaleigh joined us as both a speaker and as teller of traditional stories for one of the evenings. Shonaleigh is a Drut\\\\u2019syla, a traditional Jewish Storyteller \\\\u2013 and it is believed that she currently is the only remaining practicing Drut\\\\u2019syla. She is also the granddaughter of a Holocaust survivor. The stories she told that evening, but also the way she told them, blew me away. It was a form of \\\\u2018commemoration\\\\u2019 I had not encountered before \\\\u2013 both polished and raw and engendering a deeply emotive response that I had not quite expected. Since that evening, I have listened to Shonaleigh\\\\u2019s traditional tales many times \\\\u2013 and it is always a unique experience, responding to audience responses or demands, seamlessly shifting from one story into another without a script, never following a set plan. Listening to her made me think about the unique way her traditional stories address contemporary concerns; but also how these stories, often centuries old, engage with \\\\u2018Holocaust commemoration\\\\u2019 in a different way. In March 2017 I had the opportunity to interview Shonaleigh for this special issue, to find out more about her art, but also to ask how she considers it to fit into a Holocaust commemoration that, as the introduction has shown, has become institutionalized, standardized and quasi ritualized. Her responses are revealing and also serve to admirably conclude this Special Issue that has been trying to probe traditional modes of commemoration and offer alternative approaches to it.\", \"year\": 2018}, {\"paperId\": \"d2cad486e35ac238600b3cf7ed93d5ce6251c437\", \"title\": \"\\\\u201cYou Said the Words You Wanted Me to Hear But I Heard the Words You Couldn\\'t Bring Yourself to Say\\\\u201d: Women\\'s First Person Accounts of the Holocaust\", \"abstract\": \"Women\\'s oral documentation and autobiographies can often be pivotal factors in understanding the Holocaust from a broader perspective.

Integration was not seamless. As survivors struggled to carve spaces for themselves within the established Canadian Jewish community, their difficult wartime stories were neither easily received nor understood. When remembering this period, survivors tend to speak about employment, education, dating, integration into both the pre-war Jewish community and the larger society, and, perhaps most importantly, the creation of their own social worlds within existing and new frameworks. Forged in a transitional and tumultuous period in Quebec\\\\u2019s history, these social worlds, as this article demonstrates, are an important example of survivor agency.

Regarding individual DM, isolation of affect and self-assertion were statistically more frequent in the HN than the ON.

Through an examination of the development of the IWM Sound Archive and the historical processes that led to the inclusion of the Holocaust in the museum\\\\u2019s remit, the article argues that the material is best viewed as a curated collection of source material pertaining to the Holocaust that reflects the historical, cultural and institutional contexts within which it was gathered. The institutional setting of the museum dictated a particular approach to the collection of oral history that best suited its needs, involving both the active creation of its own oral material and the passive collection of relevant audio material produced by third parties. In addition to funding its own project interviewing survivors of the Holocaust, the IWM Sound Archive obtained copies of interviews with survivors conducted for the documentary series The World at War by TV production company Thames Television. The museum also commissioned production company October Films to re-interview a number of survivors for the UK\\\\u2019s first national Holocaust exhibition which opened at the IWM London in 2000. The article demonstrates how the diverse nature of the origins of each interview is reflected in their content and structure, which it illustrates via a comparative analysis of a select number of oral testimonies taken from the archive. In demonstrating the influence of context on content, the article makes an argument in favour of the (re)contextualisation of archived oral testimonies and posits that as a contextually produced corpus of material on the subject, this collection of oral histories can be understood as forming a contemporary response to the Holocaust.\", \"year\": 2019}, {\"paperId\": \"d69dc8c96def45f85210b0a6223a67f4023efd77\", \"title\": \"Echoes of transgenerational trauma in the lived experiences of Jewish Australian grandchildren of Holocaust survivors\", \"abstract\": \"Abstract Objective Previous experimental research has yielded inconclusive findings regarding the effects of Holocaust trauma to survivors\\\\u2019 descendants, while qualitative studies have suggested diverse long\\\\u2010term impacts of this traumatic past. While the extant literature has focused mainly on Israeli and North American children of survivors, this study drew on theories of transgenerational trauma transmission to explore the lived experiences of six Jewish Australian grandchildren of Holocaust survivors.

Among Slovak historians it has been a rather neglected tool and the volume under review represents a welcome attempt to establish oral history as a legitimate and helpful instrument of historical inquiry into the Holocaust.

Firstly, it tries to overcome the isolation of various social science disciplines. Bringing together anthropologists, historians and sociologists, it provides a much needed impetus for interdisciplinary cooperation. Its interdisciplinary nature is further enhanced by the fact that the circle of initiators and agents within the project is not limited to the academics involved but includes the technical crew and the survivors themselves on an equal footing. Secondly, the book focuses on the recollections of both Jewish and Roma survivors. The oral history approach implies a twofold process of mediation. On the one hand, memories are always already interpretations of that which is remembered and they tend to evolve over time. The second form of mediation transpires as the survivors seek to convey their recollections to a team of academically trained listeners. A substantial part of the book discusses the preparatory phase of the project in which the authors grappled with the fundamental questions of how best to approach witnesses, how to address the ethical and legal issues involved in research focusing on human subjects, and how to create the most conducive environment for the attainment of their research goals. The greatest challenge lay in the actual interviewing of the survivors. How could the researchers best deal with the strong emotions unleashed by the interviews? How would they deal with individual recollections that conflict with established historical information? The account offered of these discussions seems frank, occasionally reveals genuine insecurity and overall provides an interesting insight into the attempt of a group of academics to grapple with their exposure to the trauma of the Holocaust. The team sought to create as bare a setting for the interviews as possible in an attempt to avoid all possible distraction (here, for once, the sparse funding available to the post-communist social sciences turned out to be a blessing). The interviews were consistently conducted by two people, an older male interviewer of Jewish background and a younger female interviewer of non-Jewish origin.

Sexual violence against men and boys during the Holocaust was likely a regular occurrence, but it has remained undocumented and under-researched. Sexual violence against men, because it does not conform to prevalent gender norms and expectations, has been subjected to cultural and epistemic erasure. As a result, it is construed on the model of female rape, making it difficult to recognize male-victim specific forms of assault.

The special circumstances of the Holocaust have resulted in a documentary history which has been told from the perspective of the Nazi perpetrators. Only oral testimony can enable us to understand the actions and reactions of Jews faced with harassment, expropriation, exile, and murder. The practice of oral history was not originally designed for eliciting memories of traumatic events. Holocaust oral history requires the historian to reject the positivist conception of the objective and distanced interviewer, in favor of a position as compassionate listener to painful personal experiences. Interviews can produce less mediated, more spontaneous versions of memory, which require sensitive interpretation. The oral histories of Jewish refugees to Shanghai are examined to demonstrate how careful reading and listening can elucidate the social memories, and thus the social history, of Jews in the Holocaust. The process of interviewing also helps the historian bridge the experiential gap with survivors, enabling a better understanding of their experiences. What do you want me to do?

Less than a year after his trip to Israel, Celan committed suicide. Because his suicide followed so soon after his visit, critics have tended to identify it as a decisive moment in his biography, a moment which represents the culmination of his work and which explains why he took his life. The interpretation of this visit has invariably taken one of two forms, each of which resembles a sentimental narrative. Either the troubled poet, haunted by the events of the past, found the serenity in Israel to lay down his pen or, alternatively, the trip there served only to accentuate his sense of homelessness insofar as the holy land could not replace his lost homeland, Czernowitz. Both interpretations of this trip are based on speculations which reveal more about the agenda of the critic than Celan\\'s poems; specifically, they reveal the teleological direction critics have sought to give Celan\\'s work, so that it can be conceived as a progression toward a close. One fact that remains irrefutable about Celan\\'s trip to Israel is the interview he had on Israeli national radio with Yehuda Amichai. In the interview, Celan not only affirmed his Judaism, but also intimated what Judaism meant for him as a poet: \\\\\"I believe I can say that I am of course a Jew...Of course, Jewishness has a thematic aspect, but I don\\'t believe that the thematic aspect suffices to define Judaism. Jewishness is as it were also a pneumatic concern\\\\\" (pp. 66-7).Lydia Koelle bases the title of her recent study of Celan on this statement. Submitted as a dissertation in the Department of Catholic Theology at the University of Bonn, the study examines the religious and, in Koelle\\'s view, specifically Jewish dimensions of Celan\\'s verse which, she suggests, cannot be accounted for in a literary reading, but which require a theological approach (p. 56). Her distinction between literary criticism and theology derives in part from the German academic system where disciplines are distinguished from one another not only on the basis of their methodology, but also their subject matter. The question, nonetheless, remains in the case of Koelle\\'s book what a theological reading of Celan\\'s work is and how the subject matter of such a reading differs from that of a literary reading which heeds what is arguably the most theological of all concepts, the word.Koelle argues in her introduction that a theological approach foregrounds the \\\\\"`figures\\' and forms of expression\\\\\" (p. 24) in texts which can be identified with particular religious discourses, traditions, and cultures. In the case of her study, she underscores the Jewish elements in Celan\\'s work in order to explicate in what ways his poems can be understood as being \\\\\"pneumatically\\\\\" Jewish. The elements she isolates and analyzes stem from three main sources: the large collection of Judaica in Celan\\'s library, German and Eastern European Jewish culture (including Ashkenazi liturgy and ritual practice), and the geography of Jerusalem as it is reflected in the series of poems, now known as the Jerusalem Cycle, published in the posthumous collection Zeitgehoft. Koelle\\'s research is nearly exhaustive with regard to the volumes of Judaica in Celan\\'s library as well as to his notes and comments in the margins of his books. Moreover, she amply demonstrates her familiarity with the wealth of criticism on Celan through frequent (and often successive) citations -- a practice which admittedly tends to obscure, rather than clarify her argument. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2000}, {\"paperId\": \"dc0451de1149687c8f02b8c254b86b209a40fd4c\", \"title\": \"Performing Selves/Performing as Self: Autobiographical Films of Children of Jewish Holocaust Survivors\", \"abstract\": \"For many Holocaust survivors, one of the most difficult obstacles to overcome is the simultaneous need to tell one\\'s story and the awareness that language cannot convey the horrors of the experience. This awareness that words fall to communicate across generations, cultures, religions, etc. is the legacy of children of Jewish Holocaust survivors who both can\\'t understand and are formed by their parents\\' stories/experiences. By engaging Deb Filler\\'s film rendition of her one-woman stage show, Punch Me in the Stomach, and Abraham Ravett\\'s documentary Everything\\'s for You, I explore the ways in which film allows the second generation to confront, articulate, and ultimately resolve some of those absences and fragments that are their Holocaust narrative. This article is available in Journal of Religion & Film: https://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/jrf/vol3/iss2/3 Four. Three. Two. One. The film begins, but with no color, no sound, and no pictures. \\\\\"His name was Chaim\\\\\" flashes on the screen, white letters on black backdrop. It disappears, and is repeated in English, in Hebrew; the name, not the person signified, changes with location and relationship to equally as silent, equally as written speaker: \\\\\"My mother called him Henyek,\\\\\" \\\\\"In New York they called him Herbert, .... I called him...\\\\\". The film begins. This time with music, with color, and with the close-up of a woman in pale, white make-up, putting on deep red lipstick in the reflection of the camera-lens. She opens with a joke about an old Jewish woman on her death bed, and the make-up once vaguely reminiscent of a clown or a mime, may suddenly resurrect a Jewish-American vaudevillian history of Shylocks and sheenies, of comedy and implicit tragedy. The differences between Abraham Ravett\\'s Everything\\'s for You (1989) and Deb Filler\\'s Punch Me in the Stomach (1995) are apparent from the very beginning: Ravett immediately destabilizes the audience by assaulting them with lack--silence, absence of color, images of text on otherwise blank screen; Filler centers the audience by giving them what they expect--a soundtrack, a character, a script. And yet, I would suggest that the more subtle similarities are the most telling: aesthetically speaking, both authors rely on stark colors to unsettle the audience, to attest to the contradictions that they and their narratives embody; both narratives open with death--Chaim is past tense and the Jewish woman lays dying; and both speak to the self-reflexivity of the performances--Ravett and Filler are simultaneously writer, director, and character, 1 Levi: Performing Selves/Performing as Self Published by DigitalCommons@UNO, 1999 situated both on and off stage at all times. And, each artist almost immediately attributes this fragmented existence, the inspiration for the work, to his or her most formative identity, that of child of Jewish Holocaust survivors. In this paper, I would first like to posit this layered performance as the inheritance of children of Jewish Holocaust survivors, so that I may then explore the ways in which Ravett and Filler use physical performance to confront and, in part, resolve the fragments, gaps and silences of this legacy. I specify Jewish Holocaust survivors because, in many ways, I see Jewishness itself as inextricably linked to both physical performance and linguistic performativity during the Holocaust and, therefore, integral to the identity formation of the second generation. Admittedly, these vastly different notions of \\\\\"perform\\\\\" are rarely, if ever, discussed in tandem, and I, too, must contextualize them separately before showing how they converge in Holocaust Jewishness and the lives of second generation Jewish survivors. The more traditional understanding of performance, that of the theater in which people play roles often written for them by others, manifests itself in disparate ways during the Holocaust. European Jews such as Ida Fink and Sarah Kofman assumed Aryan identities in order to escape the camps. By consciously performing \\\\\"sameness,\\\\\" Fink and others necessarily redefined Jewishness as a series of actions and dialects that were to be avoided at all cost and, as such, 2 Journal of Religion & Film, Vol. 3 [1999], Iss. 2, Art. 3 https://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/jrf/vol3/iss2/3 rendered it equally as performable. Once in the camps, Jews were subjected to what survivor Terrence DesPres refers as a systematic \\\\\"excremental assault\\'\\' until they were forced to embody the filthy, bestial Jew of Nazi propaganda. In short, they were forced to perform Jewishness as the Nazi\\'s desire to see it. I would suggest that the connection between this type of performance, and the more theoretical discussions of linguistic performativity put forth by J.L. Austin, Judith Butler and others is the central role of audience. In her analysis of hate speech, Butler argues that much racially charged speech performs unique discursive histories of very real, deadly actions and, therefore, incites equally as real physical and emotional responses in its victims. The effectiveness of hate speech, then, depends on the written and unwritten social contracts that exist in specific locations. Everyone involved must recognize the power of the speaker to carry out the actions historically tied to the words used, and the historical lack of power of the victim to escape this hierarchy. In a similar manner, stating \\\\\"I am Jewish\\\\\" or being called \\\\\"Jew\\\\\" in Europe during the Holocaust instigated a predictable series of actions-incarceration, torture, loss of family, death. After the war, \\\\\"I am Jewish\\\\\" performs a history of atrocity that simultaneously distinguishes post-Holocaust from preHolocaust Jewishness and promises a different but equally as notable array of physical and emotional responses. In both theatrical performance and linguistic performativity, then, there is an acute awareness of different audience\\'s needs, 3 Levi: Performing Selves/Performing as Self Published by DigitalCommons@UNO, 1999 desires, fears, and ways of knowing. The success of each depends upon the subject\\'s ability to alter self according to context. Subsequently, whether or not second generation survivors desire to tell one of the many Holocaust stories that has shaped them psychologically and physically, they are taught from birth--through silence and misunderstanding--to play their stories differently for different audiences. As Lori Lefkovitz, second generation survivor, points out in \\\\\"Inherited Holocaust Memory and the Ethics of Ventriloquism,\\\\\" knowing oneself as \\\\\"Child of Holocaust Survivor...freezes us into our position as our extraordinary parent\\'s children,\\\\\" and \\\\\"second generation\\\\\" infers a precarious position that is simultaneously privileged, \\\\\"closer to the source,\\\\\" and \\\\\"emphatically not first.\\\\\" Deb Filler shows us that to survivor parents \\\\\"emphatically not first\\\\\" is fundamental in raising children. Survivor babies are \\\\\"placed on solids immediately. [They have] to be strong. [They have] to be happy\\\\\" because \\\\\"happy\\\\\" not only denotes the condition most removed from the event and those forced to endure it, it also promises that the survivors have truly survived by creating a generation that is unshaped by the Holocaust. Once outside the Jewish community, however, the second generation is recognized as \\\\\"closer to the event.\\\\\" As Filler playing her best friend\\'s mother explains, the Star of David Debby wears symbolizes the ability of the Jewish people to overcome the various \\\\\"obstacles\\\\\" that they have had to \\\\\"put up with.\\\\\" For the non-Jewish community, \\\\\"Jew\\\\\" automatically 4 Journal of Religion & Film, Vol. 3 [1999], Iss. 2, Art. 3 https://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/jrf/vol3/iss2/3 resurrects a tragic, recent history that positions Debby as a unique amalgamation of victim and survivor. By transferring the physical performance inherent in second generation identity from the daily routine to the stage and screen, Filler creates a medium in which she can become those audiences that see her differently. She may explore others\\' relationships to the Holocaust and, subsequently, to herself. But perhaps more importantly, the narrative structure dictated by film, the promise of a beginning, middle, and end, allows Filler and Ravett to unite, if not reconcile their fragmented selves if only for the duration of the film and in the confines of the frame. The first spoken word of Ravett\\'s Everything\\'s for You is \\\\\"Pop\\\\\" in his own voice. Although Ravett then positions himself off-screen as both interviewer and director, and asks questions such as \\\\\"What about your family?\\\\\" that seem to remove him personally from the material being discussed, neither Ravett, his viewing audience, nor the subject being interviewed can forget the natural power dynamic that exists between Chaim the father and Abraham the son. The task of the second generation to perform different identities becomes more problematic when disparate worlds collide because audience expectations differ. The viewing audience expects Ravett as director to control visual and aural representation and, as he chooses to be heard but not seen during the interview, he partially succeeds in fulfilling that role. But as son to the father subject who can see Abraham behind 5 Levi: Performing Selves/Performing as Self Published by DigitalCommons@UNO, 1999 the camera, Ravett cannot help but become a part of the narrative the interview is telling. Ravett leads, \\\\\"A boy and a girl?\\\\\" \\\\\"A boy and a girl\\\\\" Chaim affirms. \\\\\"When was the last time you...\\\\\" the interviewer begins before he is interrupted with the desired response. The conflation and predictability of question and answer attests to Abraham\\'s inability/unwillingness to detach himself from his father\\'s narrative. As interviewer he is asking the same questions he has obviously asked many times before as son. Because of this, the traditional view of director/interviewer as the power figure is compromised; Abraham does not have complete control of the film he is ma\", \"year\": 2016}, {\"paperId\": \"dd380a6326decbd614ceb22d8d2106d8deb8b318\", \"title\": \"Talking Versus Hearing About Holocaust Experiences\", \"abstract\": \"Whereas disclosing traumatic events to others can reduce autonomic nervous system activity and reap positive health benefits for the discloser, the physiological consequences for the listener are less clear.

One Friday, more than 100 fifth-grade students gathered in their school library and listened to a Holocaust survivor relate his World War II experiences; a teacher initiated the visit after learning that a student in another grade was the grandchild of a Polish Holocaust survivor. The World War II generation is indeed dying at a rapid rate, but there are still healthy individuals who are willing to share their stories. Oral history is an active and meaningful practice for learning about changes and continuity between generations. Grandparents, other relatives, or neighbors of many elementary school students could be interviewed, individually or by the class, to learn more about World War II. Interviews should be properly planned so as to ensure the inclusion of multiple perspectives. In this way, teachers can facilitate empathy and encourage openness to new learning opportunities. Without some accurate, prior knowledge about the World War II era, today\\'s elementary student will be unable to gain meaningful understanding of how the war impacted children, families, schools, and communities in different ways. But not all teachers have the time, knowledge, or curriculum priorities that allow such a learning experience. Many turn to the use of trade books. Trade books may tell an interesting story, but too often a trade book fails to set the story into the context of the time. This results in students having only superficial knowledge of the potential meaning of a story. The elementary section in this issue of Social Education seeks to assist busy elementary teachers by providing two detailed lesson plans using two popular instructional strategies: oral history interviews; and reading both primary sources and trade books (on the topic of Japanese internment). Both lessons (the one in this article and the one by Theresa M. McCormick that follows) employ skills in literacy essential to the understanding of history while building essential cognitive skills for historical thinking such as perceiving past events and issues as they may have been experienced by people at the time, developing historical empathy (as opposed to present-mindedness), and recognizing cause and effect in an effort to avoid unsupported generalizations. With these goals in mind, both lessons actively engage students in addressing NCSS Standards {II} Time, Continuity, and Change; (III) People, Places, and Environments; (V) Individuals, Groups, and Institutions; (VII) Production, Distribution, and Consumption; (IX) Global Connections; (X) Civic Ideals and Practice. LESSON Incorporating Multiple Perspectives Rationale: Oral history interviews have the potential of providing important information about historical events, and presenting interviewers with the challenge of evaluating multiple perspectives, interpreting information, and trying to draw accurate historical conclusions. Through the process of conducting oral history interviews students gain a greater understanding of the definition of history as well as important social communication skills. Even children in the lower grades can conduct oral history when a teacher invites appropriate, representative guests to visit the class and answer questions the children have previously agreed to ask. Teacher Background: Elementary textbooks tend to relate a very generalized narrative about World War II, emphasizing political, economic, and military leaders. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2008}, {\"paperId\": \"de9c8474bff38d82ff7202c5df03a22034325cda\", \"title\": \"Responsibility and survivor testimony\", \"abstract\": \"Abstract The phenomenology of giving testimony, of being witnessed, of witnessing oneself, and \\\\u201ccoming into life\\\\u201d are explored in this preliminary and continuing project involving survivors and interviewers.

Lerner furnished the seminar with a strong Latin American presence, while Renov\\'s scholarly interest in the question of subjectivity and the documentary brought works with compelling and complex uses of the first person to the fore. As hinted by the programmers in the first few days, the works screened gradually began to incite less emotionally harrowing experiences, easing the seminar into a truly complex engagement with the diverse effects, uses and even pleasures afforded by the wreckage of history. Arguably the most emotionally disturbing film of the seminar was Oh, Uomo (Oh, Man, 2004), the latest feature from found footage by masters Yervant Gianikian and Angela Ricci Lucchi. This final part of their First World War trilogy begins with a fantasmatic journey through the fascist imagination that is initially filled with the disciplined masculine bodies of the Italian military. However, footage of an eye operation substantially more visceral than Luis Bunuel\\'s infamous scalpel shot suddenly opens the film\\'s vision onto the war trauma that fascism was designed to repress: emaciated, starving children and soldiers with the most horrific facial injuries and limb amputations. In light of the censorship and strict regulation of images depicting the human costs of the current war in Iraq (and elsewhere), these fragments of footage from the early twentieth century appeared hauntingly contemporary. Gianikian commented in a discussion that \\\\\"Our work is dedicated to the present. The past does not exist for us.\\\\\" Nevertheless, a number of participants expressed anxiety about the ethical implications of the unrelenting succession of such clinically cold depictions of corporeal trauma. The debate over history and affect continued after the screening of an altogether different film, Mark Jonathan Harris\\'s Oscar-winning Into the Arms of Strangers: Stories of the Kindertransport (2000). Well researched and highly polished, the film organizes itself around carefully staged studio interviews with survivors of the Kindertransport (which saved thousands of Jewish children from the Holocaust). Several seminar participants remarked on the emotionally overwhelming orchestration of the material (both visually and aurally), which isolated the testimonial interviews from their historical context, potentially risking their degeneration into fetishized moments of emotional catharsis. This question of retaining the emotional power of bearing witness without diminishing the historicity of the testimonial act itself--i.e. its status as an historical event in its own right--returned during the discussion of a number of animated films that combined the morphing plasticity of worlds created by animation with the documentary authenticity of testimonial voiceover. As Renov pointed out in a discussion on the fifth day, the voices on the soundtrack of such works retain an indexical claim on the real and the historical, even though their animated images cannot. Of particular interest was Dennis Tupicoff\\'s His Mother\\'s Voice (1996), based on a radio interview with an Australian mother bearing witness to how she discovered the sudden death of her 16-year-old son. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2005}, {\"paperId\": \"e226a6695b9fc9284e4713ab469fc1e7aa1d4292\", \"title\": \"Oral History Interviews with Brigitte Friedmann Altman, December, 1989\", \"abstract\": \"Interview with Brigitte Friedmann Altman, a holocaust survivor from Memel (Klaipeda), Lithuania.

Hebb pour contribution remarquable a lapsychologie en rant que science (1996)AbstractMany human lives are marked by periods of danger, deprivation, andchallenge. Psychology and related disciplines have traditionallyemphasized the destructive consequences of such events. More recently, abeginning has been made toward balancing this one-sided perspective withgrowing interest in coping and salutogenic (health-enhancing) reactions toadversity. This paper reviews evidence from laboratory experiments onrestricted stimulation, field studies in polar stations, archival analysesof decision-making under stress, and interviews with Holocaust survivors,which attests to the fortitude and resilience of human beings in the faceof severe environmental demands. Psychologists should address the manyremaining questions -- theoretical, scientific, and practical --concerning such positive reactions to even extreme stressors.I am grateful to the Canadian Psychological Association for bestowingupon me the 1996 Donald O. Hebb Award. I have two reasons for beingespecially pleased about the award. One is that it recalls my link with,and debt to, Donald Hebb, who among his many important contributions wasthe pioneer of research on how human beings are affected by stimulusrestriction, a question that has occupied much of my scientific attentionover the past three decades.The second is that, as the citation for my award indicated, I am ageneralist in an era of ever-increasing scientific specialization. Myresearch methods cover laboratory experiments, field observations,psychophysiological measures, paper and pencil tests, interviews, andarchival analyses; the areas in which I do research include environmental,social, personality, political, cognitive, and health psychology. I havesometimes wondered whether my energies would have been better concentratedin one area rather than being focussed, sequentially or simultaneously, onwhatever question seemed most intriguing at a given time. In retrospect,I\\'m happy that I followed my interests wherever they led me; but it wasgratifying to discover that my fellow psychologists also consider this tohave been a fruitful strategy.Actually, while my enthusiasms have been varied, they were notcompletely random. I discovered one connecting thread only a few yearsago, when I was being interviewed for an oral history project involvingchild survivors of the Holocaust. The interviewer asked me what the commontheme was in my apparently unconnected areas of research. I told him thatI recognized none; but thinking about it afterwards, I realized that myresearch has had one central topic: how human beings react to and copewith events that range from the unpleasant to the catastrophic --experiences that I subsume under the term, \\\\\"challenging\\\\\".In each of my research areas, most of my colleagues were concentratingon the aversive aspects and adverse consequences of challengingsituations. But I kept winding up, often to my own surprise, with resultsand interpretations that revealed that all of these experiences andenvironments also had pleasant features and favourable outcomes. Not onlythat, but it became clear that many participants in such experiencesthemselves had recognized and reported these positive characteristicsalong with negative ones.The stressful experiences that I have studied include some that arenovel but not harmful, as well as some that are traumaticallylife-threatening -- from participation in laboratory experiments onreduced sensory input, through living in remote and isolated capsules suchas polar and space stations, solitary confinement in prison, to being thetarget of genocidal persecution. At the most severe end of this range, itis clear that some experiences are so shattering as to leave very few ifany survivors without physical or psychological scars; and, because peopledo vary in their ability to overcome adverse circumstances, even less direevents have traumatic effects on some. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 1997}, {\"paperId\": \"e49c868c7e53ace8855af22aef293f4fd246a5c5\", \"title\": \"Survivor Testimonies and the Problem of Time\", \"abstract\": \"\\\\nTestimonies of Holocaust survivors have had an essential influence on public engagement with the Shoah in recent decades.

The past decades have therefore seen unprecedented efforts to record the testimonies of Holocaust survivors in order to safeguard the immediacy of their accounts.

Focusing on four interviews conducted with a Jewish Holocaust survivor in 1946, 1995, 1998, and 2004 respectively, I explore how biological time, historical time, recording time, and the temporality of narrative have shaped the narrated memories. As I argue, the different temporal entanglements have allowed for starkly different reconfigurations and reconstructions of the past. This renders the study of the epistemic constitutive nature of entangled temporalities important not only for Holocaust studies, but also for the history of knowledge, a field which has recently turned to processes of forgetting and ignorance.\\\\n\", \"year\": 2023}, {\"paperId\": \"e569f6dc90f7a49701d772f7bb95adc0a2854e1a\", \"title\": \"OTTOMAN TURKISH GENOCIDE OF ARMENIANS: THE LEGACY OF TRAUMA\", \"abstract\": \"Although there is a plethora of literature on the generational legacy of trauma in the offspring of Holocaust survivors, there are limited data on the impact of trauma on other populations.

The purpose of the current study was to investigate the impact of the Ottoman Turkish Genocide of Armenians on second and third generation survivors. Eleven subjects participated in this qualitative study that was comprised of a semi-structured interview and the Relationship Scales Questionnaire (RSQ), used to better understand relationship dynamics among participants. Overall, the participants had difficulties coping with anger and either described having a temper, avoiding anger, projecting anger, or internalizing anger. The majority of participants had negative pervasive attitudes about the world, categorized as either anxious or a distrustful, fatalistic, or pessimistic perspective. Over half of the participants in this study demonstrated a capacity for resilience. The majority of participants seemed to have an attachment style characterized by being trustworthy and dependable but had difficulty trusting and depending on others. The findings of this study were consistent in both children and grandchildren of survivors and no differences were found between generations. Overall the findings of this study are congruent with the current literature.

One of these issues is the experiences of groups who challenge our conceptual frameworks and present opportunities for developing different analytical methods. The testimonies of the Jewish Sonderkommando, or forced crematorium workers, of AuschwitzBirkenau present such an opportunity by defying the categories used to describe victims and perpetrators, and by forcing us to reconsider how humans survive when conditions are extreme and violent. This paper argues that the testimonies of the Sonderkommando demonstrate that the conditions of their incarceration necessitated the construction of unique, situational system of personal morality and humanity and that their postHolocaust lives are marred by extreme difficulty in attempts to construct usable narratives about their experiences. Using published testimony and interviews as a source base, the paper endeavors to open up a space in which the coping strategies of the Sonderkommando can be analyzed. To do so, it proposes two particular frames of analysis: the equivocal psyche (a mechanism that, in the absence of cultural, moral, and emotional guidance, constructs an ethical continuum, allowing for a range of mental responses to trauma), and usable narratives (the construction of a personal story of Holocaust trauma that can adequately convey the gravity of the situation and explain one\\\\u2019s actions in that period in a way that does not offend the beliefs of the survivor and their post-Holocaust context).

However, producing evidence based insights into victims\\' behavior is challenging. Perpetrators frequently destroyed camp documentations; victims\\' perspective remains dispersed in thousands of oral history interviews with survivors. Listening to, watching, or reading these thousands of interviews is not viable, and there is no established computational approach to gather systematic evidence from a large number of interviews. In this study, by applying methods and concepts of molecular physics, we developed a conceptual framework and computational approach to study thousands of human stories and we investigated 6628 interviews by survivors of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. We applied the concept of state space and the Markov State Model to model the ensemble of 6628 testimonies. The Markov State Model along with the Transition Path Theory allowed us to compare the way women and men remember their time in the camp. We found that acts of solidarity and social bonds are the most important topics in their testimonies. However, we found that women are much more likely to address these topics. We provide systematic evidence that not only were women more likely to recall solidarity and social relations in their belated testimonies but they were also more likely to perform acts of solidarity and form social bonds in Auschwitz-Birkenau. Oral history interviews with Holocaust survivors constitute an important digital cultural heritage that documents one of the darkest moments in human history; generally, oral history collections are ubiquitous sources of modern history and significant assets of libraries and archives.

Oxford: Oxford University Press: 2008. 178 pp. $24.95. If scholars, historians, and survivors could live another hundred years, their stories about their World War II experience would still only be partially told. As we find more stories about what occurred during World War II, we realize that there is so much more yet to be uncovered about those dark years. There are hundreds of thousands of pages that have been written about the Holocaust already. Bad Arolsen, located in Northern Germany, is reported to have fifty million pages of documents dealing with the horrors of Nazi occupation in every corner of the occupied lands. Only recently have these documents become available to scholars and museums. The author, Emeritus Sociology Professor Suzanne Vromen, a French-speaking Belgian, has been able to use her knowledge of both the French language and Belgium in her research to produce a major contribution to the study of the rescue of children by nuns in Belgium during the Holocaust. Fifty of these heroic nuns were honored by Yad Vashem as the righteous among the nations. While there are many studies on the Holocaust and why and when it occurred, there is still an inadequate amount of research about heroism and goodness during World War II. We know of many individuals who have risked their lives to save Jewish victims, but thete are few studies of institutions such as convents, hospitals, and schools that devoted much of their effort to save Jewish victims, especially children. Vromen has interviewed sixteen women and twelve men who were hidden as children, eight nuns, and one priest, as well as other individuals who escorted children to the convents. The rescue was undertaken to a large extent by the Committee of the Defense of Jews, which was organized by Ghert Jospa, a Jewish engineer, as well as six other Jews and one non-Jew. This rescue effort was increased in 1942, when the Nazis introduced a policy of sending Belgians into forced labor in Germany, a development that impelled many Belgians to go into hiding and to intensify their resistance against the Nazis. A number of these people hid in convents and monasteries. Belgium had approximately 56,000-60,000 Jews at one point in 1942; when the roundup took place half the Jews went to their death and the other half went into hiding. Despite the existence of an antisemitic Flemish Nazi organization called the Flemish National Front, established in 1933, the Belgian people were sympathetic and cooperated in hiding and rescuing Jewish people. The book focuses largely on the experiences of the Jewish children hidden in these convents as well as on heroic nuns. These children had to cope with changing identities and names; many children had to be wise and careful to be sure they would not betray their new identity. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2010}, {\"paperId\": \"e80922a1df2604e4b945a543eef2312f5457eb66\", \"title\": \"Emerging Technologies and the Advent of the Holocaust \\\\u201cHologram\\\\u201d\", \"abstract\": null, \"year\": 2021}, {\"paperId\": \"e822ddb96fa93687c831e99b6cbafeaa198175b7\", \"title\": \"The Holocaust and Education\", \"abstract\": \"Michael Berenbaum\\'s understanding of and expertise on \\\\\"the paradigmatic event of evil of our time\\\\\" is beyond question, Mr. Goldberg points out. Berenbaum\\'s mandate now is to determine with his staff the best ways of sharing with the education community what will soon reach more than 100,000 hours of testimony from eyewitnesses to the Holocaust. In January 1997 Michael Berenbaum became the president and chief executive officer of Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation, the organization established and chaired by filmmaker Steven Spielberg after he completed Schindler\\'s List in 1993. Spielberg has said more than once that this organization is the central and most important work of his career. Since 1994 the foundation has been recording eyewitness testimony on the Holocaust (Shoah in Hebrew) and set as its goal the high-quality recording of at least 50,000 eyewitnesses. The vast majority of the eyewitnesses are survivors, but liberators, trial prosecutors, and other relevant witnesses are also included. This is a race with time because the war in Europe ended more than half a century ago. Michael Berenbaum is exceptionally qualified to take on the responsibility of heading this large and complex undertaking, now nearing the conclusion of its recording phase and entering its distribution and educational phase. Berenbaum served as deputy director of President Carter\\'s Commission on the Holocaust, whose 1979 report led to the creation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. For more than 15 years Berenbaum worked to bring into being the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C., and to bring intellectual and emotional focus to its displays and material. For his work as project director and then as director of the museum\\'s research institute, Berenbaum was lauded by Museum Chairman Miles Lerman as one of a handful of people most responsible for the creation of the Holocaust Museum: \\\\\"Many of the achievements of this institution are here as the result of Michael\\'s dedication, determination, and unyielding optimism.\\\\\" Museum Director Walter Reich praised Berenbaum for participating \\\\\"very centrally in the conceptualization of the museum\\'s permanent exhibition\\\\\" and for assembling artifacts and supervising research activities to support the museum\\'s vision. With his background in the Holocaust Museum and as the author or editor of 11 books on the Shoah, including the widely distributed The Worm Must Know: A History of the Holocaust (Little, Brown, 1993), Berenbaum\\'s understanding of and expertise on \\\\\"the paradigmatic event of evil of our time\\\\\" is beyond question. His mandate now is to determine with his staff the best ways of sharing with the education community what will soon reach more than 100,000 hours of testimony. The task is very much analogous to what he faced in conceptualizing and organizing the Holocaust Museum. No individual could possibly view even a sizable fraction of this recorded information. Just what should be done with this material? What is to become of it? How can material gathered from 45 countries be transformed into a useful format for future generations of students and museum goers? The centerpiece of the project, according to Berenbaum, is without doubt the testimony itself. All the interviewers are volunteers who undergo 30 hours of rigorous training over several days. Many of the interviewers are psychologists, historians, survivors themselves, or teachers who can devote only a few days each month to the foundation\\'s work. Even so, only those people considered highly qualified to interview Holocaust survivors are selected to work with professional videographers to record testimony in the subjects\\' homes. The average tape runs just over two hours and includes information on events before and after the war, as well as the recollections of wartime experiences. Of course, at least half of the testimony focuses on experiences during the Holocaust. Prior to conducting the interviews, the interviewers complete a 40-page questionnaire on the facts of each interviewee\\'s life. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 1997}, {\"paperId\": \"e88be30949de429bef853e521d1d61991ab4a089\", \"title\": \"Sharing Past Traumas: a Comparison of Communication Behaviours in Two Groups of Holocaust Survivors\", \"abstract\": \"The present study explores patterns of sharing past traumatic experiences. Holocaust related communication behaviours and their consequences in terms of attitudes and knowledge were studied in two groups of families who survived the Holocaust; fifteen families whose parents were imprisoned in a concentration camp, and fifteen families whose parents were involved in active resistance during World War II. Both parents and first-born child were interviewed by means of a structured interview. The results indicated that there was more sharing of the traumatic experiences in ~the families of ex-partisans: (a) communication on Holocaust related issues was more legitimate in these families, (b) children of ex-partisans had more knowledge about the Holocaust and about their parent\\\\u2019s past and (c) they expressed more positive attitudes toward the survivors. The implications of these findings for the understanding of the psychological consequences of massive psychic traumas are discussed. In the long history of man to man brutality one phenomenon stands out in its atrocity and incredibility the extermination of the. Jewish population in Europe during World War II. Yet the psychological consequences of this phenomenon have not been systematically investigated. Most of the existing reports have drawn on clinical case studies and autobiographies (e.g. Eitinger 1963, 1973, Krystal 1968, 1971, Epstein 1979). The long term effects of this massive psychic traumatization on both the survivors and their descendants remain unknown. The scarcity of systematic, non-clinical studies on the effects of the Holocaust may be seen as one of the manifestations of the conspiracy of silence that has surrounded this subject. The first to break this conspiracy were the clinicians in their role as helping professionals. In the case of the scientists, the positive connotations inherent in helping are absent.

For the survivor, talking about this experience (sometimes for the first time since the war) is often one of great emotion and trauma. These women relive their experiences of sexual assault while giving their memories voice, motivated by the desire to put their stories \\\\u2018on the record\\\\u2019. In this paper, I focus on four interviews with women survivors and explore \\\\u2018what happens next\\\\u2019 when traumatic memories are shared. I consider how emotions from the event are present in the interview, the inevitable intertwining of memories of sexual violence and those of other traumatic Holocaust events, as well as the way the interview space, and interviewer/interviewee interactions within the interview, affect how emotion is expressed and what emotions are experienced. I also consider ethical implications for how oral historians can use these kinds of difficult interviews, particularly when accessing an existing archive of interviews. Introduction Talking about sexual violence and the Holocaust brings up complicated emotions for many women in the Shoah Foundation\\\\u2019s Visual History Archive. The process of giving Holocaust testimony is arguably an emotive process in itself. But talking about sexual violence in the context of the genocide often leads to complex, layered memories of grief, guilt, shame, trauma, anger, pain and anguish.1 For many survivors, their experiences of sexual violence are intricately intertwined with their Holocaust experiences, and remembering separation from family members, deportations, the people who saved them and even liberation can also mean recalling their memories of abuse and assault. For Holocaust historians interested in sexual violence, oral history is usually the preferred, and often only, source of information. Some scholars have made use of Nazi documentation, but these records are always perpetrator-centred. These documents have proved fruitful in explaining how Nazi institutions dealt with sexual violence against Jewish women, particularly the Wehrmacht (the German army).2 However, they tell us very little about the experience of the survivor or about the prevalence of sexual violence, given that most assaults were not reported to Nazi authorities and many that were reported were not prosecuted. Survivor writings, such as memoirs, poetry and other forms of literature, have been fruitful for discussions of sexual violence.3 In these varied works, survivors discuss fears of sexual violence, moments of vulnerability at camp intake and witnessing sexual abuse against friends and family. While valuable, research utilising written literature and memoirs taps into a small subset of the survivor community with the inclination and ability to communicate their experiences in writing. In light of these evidentiary limitations, the majority of scholars interested in exploring the experiences of Jewish women and sexual violence turn to survivor testimony. Oral testimony allows scholars to gain the insights of multiple survivors, particularly those whose stories may not have been recorded in other forms, offering a breadth of experiences to draw on. This article is drawn from a larger study investigating survivor testimonies discussing sexual violence collected by the USC Shoah Foundation Institute between 1994 and 1999. Holocaust testimony projects are often large scale, but the Shoah Foundation\\\\u2019s venture is the largest collection of audio-visual interviews in the world to date. The Foundation\\\\u2019s Visual History Archive (VHA), its digitised database and testimony repository, houses nearly 52,000 interviews with Holocaust survivors. The testimonies were collected in the mid1990s across 56 countries and in 32 different languages, creating an archive of rich and varied survivor stories. The project was famously begun by Steven Spielberg following the critical and commercial success of his Holocaust film Schindler\\\\u2019s List (1993), leading to his establishment of the Foundation (initially known as the Survivors of the Shoah Foundation) in order to record the stories of as many Holocaust survivors as possible. The Foundation\\\\u2019s ambitious goal of 50,000 interviews by the year 2000 was reached and surpassed, with the resulting testimonies preserved in digital format and made available via institutional subscription around the world.4 Baldwin, \\\\u2018And What Happened Next?\\\\u2019 33 The Shoah Foundation is not without its critics, and its approach to testimony collection and interview procedure has certainly influenced the way difficult stories are told within the VHA.5 The interview process was heavily regulated by the Foundation: interviewer guidelines gave pages of instructions to the volunteer interviewers to ensure consistency between testimonies.6 The interviews were to follow a particular narrative arc: pre-war life in Europe, wartime persecution and postwar regeneration.7 This prescribed format led to a structured interview, and necessitated an \\\\u2018interventionist interviewer\\\\u2019 who directed the flow of the discussion.8 While some interviewers are less intrusive than others, the general prescriptiveness of the interview process has largely resulted in fairly guided and interviewer-heavy testimonies. The discussion of sensitive, emotional topics, such as sexual violence, are directly impacted by this, as this article shows. In this article, I consider the testimonies of four women survivors who conducted interviews with the Shoah Foundation between 1995 and 1997 in the United States.9 The testimonies are drawn from a much larger study on sexual violence against Jewish women during the Holocaust. For this project, I watched all 989 English-language interviews conducted by and stored in the digital archive of the Shoah Foundation that were indexed with sexual violence keywords.10 My work is an archival study of the narratives of sexual violence in the VHA, and considers not only what we can learn about sexual violence through these testimonies, but also how these stories are shaped by the institutional context of the interviews, the way survivors have interpreted and reinterpreted their experiences of sexual violence and their decisions to talk about these memories to the Shoah Foundation. Talking about sexual violence during the Holocaust is never easy. For some of the women in my sample, the interview with the Shoah Foundation is the first time they have spoken about these experiences after four decades of silence. Others use the interview as a chance to tell their families (who will receive a copy of the videotaped session) the truth of what happened to them during the war years. These discussions are typically painful, distressing, grief-provoking and difficult for the women. These are not uncommon emotions in Holocaust testimonies, and previous scholars have noted the intricate and complicated layers of trauma survivors carry in their interviews.11 However, the untold nature of many of these stories, and the absence of those like them in Holocaust historiography, which had only just begun to probe gendered experiences in the 1990s, made stories of sexual violence particularly difficult for women to disclose. The interviews are thus loaded with different layers of emotion: that of the initial assault, the cumulative distress of living with the experience for decades before the interview, and the emotion of retelling the story in the interview setting, all wrapped in the larger, traumatic narrative of their Holocaust experience. In this article, I discuss how women\\\\u2019s testimonies about sexual violence are infused with emotion. The testimonies demonstrate the embodiment of past emotion in the survivors\\\\u2019 present, as they recall traumatic memories of sexual violence. They show how emotions can be created within the interview space, either through the act of recollection or due to the interaction with the interviewer. I argue that memories and narratives of sexual violence during the Holocaust can express tangled emotions that make remembering and talking about these events particularly difficult in the present. \\\\u2018You are beyond your own help\\\\u2019: Past emotions are also present emotions Recalling trauma means talking about emotions experienced in the past, but it can also mean reexperiencing that pain. In his pivotal work on Holocaust testimony, Lawrence Langer argues that survivors are not \\\\u2018reviving\\\\u2019 their memories of traumatic experiences in their interviews: \\\\u2018There is no need to revive what has never died\\\\u2019.12 Holocaust survivors live with their complicated memories constantly, and the interview space becomes a place where not only memory is shared but also emotion. A key example of this is Esther G.\\\\u2019s testimony.13 In 1944, Esther was sent to the Skar\\\\u017cysko-Kamienna labour camp in Poland when she was seventeen years old. This camp has become infamous for the rampant sexual violence perpetrated against Jewish female prisoners by not only the guards, but also the German Jewish men, women and children from Hungary are separated for selection on the ramp at Auschwitz II-Birkenau, 1944.

A major part of this thesis involved oral history interviews with refugee survivor families (mainly second-generation participants), and studying the interviews, letters, memoirs, and reminiscences of the first generation. Material culture objects were also analysed, and curated in an electronic archive (available for review).\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0This thesis charts the slowly evolving significances of the objects throughout the various stages of the object migration journey. It examines themes of cultural identity, intergenerational memory, collection practices, and the private-public tensions inherent in the institutional custody of family objects. These themes are explored in three chapters, the first of which defines the German-Jewish refugee archive in New Zealand against the existing literature on displaced Jewish objects, by contextualising the New Zealand objects within the specific historical circumstances determining their owners\\\\u2019 migration journeys. The final two chapters analyse the usage and meanings of the objects in the \\\\u2018private archive\\\\u2019 of the family, and the \\\\u2018public archive\\\\u2019 of local and international collecting institutions.\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0Drawing on insights from migration, material culture, Holocaust, and memory studies, this thesis is premised on the widely accepted argument that such mementoes function as mobile depositories of cultural identity and knowledge to ensure continuity between generations. Considering objects as nodes of memory for remembering a German-Jewish past (between Europe and New Zealand) characterised by the traumatic rupture of first generation silence, brings my research into conversation with the work of second-generation scholar Marianne Hirsch and Nina Fischer. But by addressing the role of collective memory and cultural identity in determining the future location and preservation of such artefacts, this thesis significantly extends the findings of Hirsch and Fischer beyond the private sphere to interrogate the perspectives of both families and collecting institutions. In doing so, it argues that New Zealand\\\\u2019s German-Jewish refugee objects bear multiple identities and meanings as a result of their dispersed, transnational history. In light of current international repatriation movements to return such artefacts to Germany, the provenance and significance of these objects is particularly pertinent today, as the first person authenticity of survivors rapidly fades, and the memorial sphere transforms to accommodate this change.\", \"year\": null}, {\"paperId\": \"ed8b373a34cb55a9015bc553720de7618a5e4e46\", \"title\": \"Elie Wiesel : conversations\", \"abstract\": \"Elie Wiesel has given hundreds of interviews.

COMPLEXITY OF LONG-TERM PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF POLITICAL REPRESSIONS IN LITHUANIA Evaldas Kazlauskas, Danut\\\\u0117 Gailien\\\\u0117 Summary OBJECTIVE:\\\\u00a0This study examined long-term consequences of political repressions during the Soviet regime in Lithuania. Between 1940 and 1958 more than 300,000 Lithuanians were arrested and deported to Siberia (Anusauskas, 1996). Conditions of imprisonment in Gulag camps were extremely hard and mortality rate from exhaustion and disease was high. Victims who managed to return back to Lithuania suffered from persistent persecutions. Traumatic experiences of former political prisoners were neglected for decades; they had to keep in secret the fact of the imprisonment. Less than 5,000 survivors of political imprisonment still live in Lithuania. Since the introduction of posttraumatic stress disorder in DSM-III (1980) trauma effects have been studied mostly in terms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). But clinicians and trauma researchers acknowledge controversies in modern understanding of PTSD (Yahuda, MacFarlane, 1995). Severe impairments in personality of victims have been reported by clinicians working with survivors of holocaust, sexual abuse, and victims of torture, but these changes in personality are not accepted in current understanding of PTSD. The concept of PTSD receives more and more critics due to limitations in describing psychological effects after long term traumatic experiences that may lasts for years. Complex posttraumatic stress disorder has been introduced (Herman, 1992) in result of these discussions to describe variety of effects of long term trauma, and acceptance of this concept is growing in the field. There are only few studies on psychological effects of political repressions in former Soviet Union territory. This is the first study of psychological effects of political imprisonment in Lithuania. The goal of present study was to examine traumatic experiences and psychological effects among non-clinical sample of former Lithuanian political prisoners. METHOD:\\\\u00a0The group of former political prisoners (N=50), with a history of deportation to Gulag camps, was compared with an age and sex matched control group (N=50). Former political prisoners were imprisoned for 6.9 years on average. 43.1 years have passed since their return to Lithuania at a time of research. Semi-structured interviews were used to measure experiences during and after imprisonment. Posttraumatic effects were measured using Lithuanian versions of self-rating scales: Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (Mollica et al., 1992), Impact of Event Scale - Revised (Weiss, Marmar, 1996), Trauma Symptom Checklist (Briere, Runtz, 1989). CONCLUSIONS:\\\\u00a0Results suggest that traumatic experiences dealing with political imprisonment and exile have long-term complex posttraumatic effects on Lithuanian former political prisoners. Concept of complex posttraumatic disorder is partly supported by results of this study. Limitations of the study due to retrospective nature of the study, elderly age of participants and control group selection are discussed. Further research is required to assess the impact of political oppression during Soviet regime on population of former Soviet Republics.\", \"year\": 2003}, {\"paperId\": \"ede12214e3ac26f78e71de310c3bbe318d067816\", \"title\": \"\\\\u2018To Speak for Those Who Cannot\\\\u2019: Masha Rol\\\\u2019nikaite on the Holocaust and Sexual Violence in German-Occupied Soviet Territories\", \"abstract\": null, \"year\": 2020}, {\"paperId\": \"ee26dbeac1c6e6a46e685836875dd28e3c519616\", \"title\": \"Sister in Sorrow: Life Histories of Female Holocaust Survivors from Hungary (review)\", \"abstract\": \"From the minute I started reading Ilana Rosen\\\\u2019s Sister in Sorrow: Life Histories of Female Holocaust Survivors from Hungary, I sensed a kindred spirit\\\\u2014a child of Holocaust survivors like myself, who chose to pursue a doctoral study related to her family background.

Even though the new opportunities that the Soviet state offered energized many young Jews, it is difficult to judge whether it was a widespread trend. It seems that many members of the Jewish communities, even in Minsk, continued to practice Jewish customs and religious rituals secretly. Moreover, a part of the Jewish cultural elite who were enthusiastic about the Soviet project fostered the idea of a Jewish cultural autonomy. In the 1920s, Yiddish was granted status as a state language and half of the Jewish children went to Yiddish schools (Leonid Smilovicki, \\\\u201cShkola na Yiddishe v pervyje desjatiletija Sovetskoj vlasti.

Nevertheless, all of these projects were already terminated by the late 1930s, when almost all representatives of Yiddish literature had been exterminated. Being one of first attempts to write an oral history of the Holocaust in the Soviet Union and simultaneously a broader study of Soviet Jewry, Pioneers and Partisans has great potential to become required reading on the Jewish history of the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, the contributions go far beyond these fields. Making the categories of age and gender central to her analysis, Walke\\\\u2019s work also has its place in youth and gender studies. The book can be recommended for oral historians and anthropologists who wish to strengthen their methodology, since it gives a fascinating example of how interviews may be used.

As we are reminded every day, digital technologies have revolutionized just about every aspect of our lives, both at home and at the university. As Schrum et al explain in their chapter, Oral History in the Digital Age, \\\\u201cThe Internet has greatly expanded the capacity of oral historians to record and disseminate ordinary voices from around the world on an almost limitless array of topics. Oral history, a powerful tool for researching, teaching, and learning about the past is not new, but widespread access to it is\\\\u201d (512). In this field, digital technologies have become integral to the \\\\u201crecording of oral history, as well as the dual imperatives of access and preservation\\\\u201d (Boyd 285). While it is already possible to record interviews more quickly and cheaply, to preserve them in smaller packages and with better sound, and to access collections more easily, the \\\\u201creal revolution,\\\\u201d according to Boyd, will be a \\\\u201cchange in consciousness about how oral history, as a history resource, can be engaged and discovered more easily, more widely and effectively distributed, and ultimately, more responsibly preserved\\\\u201d (286). This is what we are going to discuss: the way digital technologies can help professors use oral histories as an engaging teaching tool in various disciplines, which is to say, to actually realize their potential -to use oral histories in educational contexts to fulfill the legacy for which they were intended. We hypothesize that using video oral histories can lead to a high level of understanding and an integration of various kinds of learning. The learning is inherently active and, for most students, powerfully transformative. In Lynn E. Swaner\\\\u2019s words, working with oral histories, students \\\\u201cbegin to question, test, and reformulate\\\\u201d their old ways of making meaning and \\\\u201ctheir views of themselves and the world in which they live\\\\u201d (18). Let\\\\u2019s take a moment to think briefly about all the different ways the new technologies and the Internet have changed oral history. In his chapter, \\\\u201cAchieving the Promise of Oral History in a Digital Age,\\\\u201d published in the 2011 Oxford Handbook of Oral History, Doug Boyd documents the many and varied ways that the digital revolution has already impacted recording, accessing and preserving of oral history. From cumbersome early 20th century audio recording technologies, exotic and available to only a few, we have moved to the YouTube generation where almost everyone can record and distribute video worldwide. As amazing, and speedy, as this journey with technology has been, this is but the beginning of the real revolution of oral history that current technology makes possible. For one thing, technology is changing perceptions and definitions of oral history. Oral history has always meant different things to different people in different contexts. It was a way to hand family stories down from one generation to another; it was a formal interview documenting a specific event, a formal autobiography, or an informal testimony. Add rapidly developing technologies, and the varieties of oral histories grow even greater (Schrum 500). For example, consider these two quite different scenarios. From 1936-1938 workers in the Federal Writers\\\\u2019 Project interviewed about 2000 ex-slaves, and transcribed those handwritten interviews (Giel 195). Today as part of an oral history archives project called Telling Their Stories, high school students at the Urban School of San Francisco conduct and videotape 2-hour interviews with Bay Area Holocaust survivors in their homes and post them on a public website. Then, too, it wasn\\\\u2019t that long ago that if you talked about using oral histories, you were talking about ordering written transcripts of interviews you discovered by using the index of a printed catalog. You experienced oral history by reading an edited transcript of an interview. But now, with each new technology has come new formats and broader audiences. Radio and Studs Terkel, for example, brought interviews to people who probably never heard the phrase \\\\u201coral history,\\\\u201d and then videotaping changed things all over again. Back in 1991, Dan Sipe argued that video was underutilized by oral historians. While the use of digital video recording in the field is not yet standard practice, and is still debated by some oral historians and archivists, today\\\\u2019s potential oral history users, like college students, expect to find a streamed video interview by searching Google. In fact, many of today\\\\u2019s oral history projects are being done specifically for the Internet. For example, the Densho Digital Archive of video interviews and other supporting documents and photographs recording the history of Japanese Americans was created with full Internet access in mind (Schrum 508). Smaller projects, like the Urban School of San Francisco\\\\u2019s \\\\u201cTelling Their Stories\\\\u201d mentioned above, are appearing almost daily over the Internet. Despite this trend, the vast majority of oral history collections, in print, audio and video, are still available only at a specific physical location.

In fact, the book defies generic conventions: it is based in historical fact and on extensive interviews conducted by Schwartz, which are partly cited verbatim in the text, but the historical record and interview materials are embedded in a lyrical narrative that binds past and present, Europe, the US and Israel, and two or three generations. Genre determinations are further confounded by numerous photographs and, on one page, a detailed recipe for making Berches, or potato bread (no explanation for the recipe is given, other than numerous textual references to the bread being eaten). The overall style and eminent readability of the work\\\\u2014it is difficult to put the book down once begun\\\\u2014remind me of Alison Owings\\\\u2019s Frauen: German Women Recall the Third Reich (1995). Like Owings, Schwartz has a talent for interweaving the interview questions and responses in such a fashion that they are in no way tedious (as interview exchanges often can be). In many ways, her quest to discover the truth about her immigrant father\\\\u2019s native village in Germany reads like a detective story. She effectively engages the reader as a co-investigator by constantly inserting metatextual doubts, questions, comments, and reservations about her interviewees\\\\u2019 responses\\\\u2014all clearly marked in italics. The reader is automatically drawn into the author\\\\u2019s asides and cannot help but be caught up in trying to ferret out the truth when multiple, and sometimes contradictory, versions of events are recounted. Already the title of Schwartz\\\\u2019s book suggests the oxymoronic nature of the task the author has set herself: her father repeatedly claimed, as she was growing up in the US, that in his home village in Southern Germany, named Benheim in this book, Christians and Jews lived together peacefully for centuries, and furthermore\\\\u2014and most surprisingly\\\\u2014that the Christians helped their Jewish neighbors during the twelve years of the Third Reich. Since this was a unique story among stories emerging from the Nazi era and the Holocaust, and since the author both wanted and needed her father\\\\u2019s stories to be true, she decided as an adult to pursue them to discover whether they had, in fact, been a true reflection of her father\\\\u2019s life in the village. Her quest takes her from New York to Benheim to Israel, and back and forth again many times, before she feels ready to write the book. She begins by interviewing Jewish survivors from Benheim who emigrated as a group to New York and left Germany early enough in the 1930s not to be deported by the Nazis. These initial contacts, as well as later ones, prove to be serendipitous as the interviewees provide her with an ever-growing list of additional contacts. Schwartz ends up interviewing not only the Benheim \\\\u00e9migr\\\\u00e9s in New York, but also Jews and Christians in Benheim itself and environs, as well as Jewish emigrants who left Benheim as a group and founded a new village in Israel. I was amazed at the breadth of experience represented in her sampling. Toward the end of the book, she also discovers a family of half Jewish children (now adults), who were also part of the larger Benheim story. Schwartz further expands her sample by talking to numerous (adult) children of those who were adults in Benheim during the Nazi era. The result is an extremely comprehensive picture of what happened to the inhabitants of a German village with a considerable Jewish population (30+ percent) during the Third Reich. To contextualize her sample, she also visits two other, somewhat larger villages in the area and compares interviewees\\\\u2019 responses there with those of the Benheimers. I was amazed by the variation in experience, the different kinds of images and events that were retained in people\\\\u2019s memories\\\\u2014sometimes in extraordinary detail, and the interviewees\\\\u2019 readiness to plunge back into dark places of their personal histories. The author must have had a special gift in the realm of interpersonal relations to get people to open up to her the way they do in the interviews.

Trauma produces excess. Overwhelmed by external stimuli, the traumatized mind cannot process what is happening while it is happening. Trauma\\'s story, then, is not a cohesive narrative of events, but its aftermath of perpetual conflict between denial and telling. The traumatized can never say what happened, yet they never stop trying to say. As traumatologist Judith Herman, M.D.1 explains, trauma \\\\\"surfaces not as a verbal narrative but as a symptom\\\\\" that at once signals \\\\\"the existence of an unspeakable secret and deflect[s] attention from it\\\\\" (Trauma and Recovery 1). Trauma sets in motion a vicious cycle that never resolves: trauma erases the possibility of witnessing; yet validating the very occurrence of trauma requires witnessing. In interviewing Holocaust survivors, Dori Laub2 found that \\\\\"the very circumstance of being inside the event [. . .] made unthinkable the very notion that a witness could exist.\\\\\" No one, neither Nazis nor those they imprisoned, could observe the Holocaust from the outside. There was no outside of its \\\\\"coercively totalitarian and dehumanizing framework.\\\\\" Indeed, Laub concludes, \\\\\"one might say that there was, thus, historically no witness to the Holocaust\\\\\" (Laub 66).While Laub speaks to the impossibility of witnessing the Holocaust from the inside, his claim resonates with other historical traumas as well. For example, European colonial expansion across the globe-its settlements, missionaries, and policies of forced assimilation-also rendered witnessing from the inside \\\\\"unthinkable\\\\\" through its \\\\\"totalitarian and dehumanizing framework\\\\\" of genocide in the name of civilizing barbarian nations. If traumatic events effectively erase themselves, as Laub suggests, then witnesses exist only outside the events, such as post-event generations carrying the passed-down testimonies of those who survived. Witnessing the witness, that is, may be the only way to tell trauma. Reading traumatic literature is a form of witnessing the (outsider) witness. Even as outsider witnesses (i.e., writers of traumatic literature) and those witnessing them (i.e., readers of traumatic literature) can never get inside of what happened, literature represents trauma as it contends with \\\\\"the vexed intersection of facts and meaning, events and narratives\\\\\" (Roth 93).3Colonial trauma and Once Were WarriorsOnce Were Warriors, Alan Duff\\'s controversial, bestselling novel about colonial trauma in contemporary Aotearoa New Zealand4 contends with the \\\\\"vexed intersection\\\\\" of facts (Aotearoa New Zealand\\'s history of Maori subjection to European rule)5 and meaning (what those events signify in a postcolonial nation). As the back cover states, Duff\\'s novel provides \\\\\"a harrowing vision of his country\\'s indigenous people two hundred years after the English conquest.\\\\\" Set in the fictional Pine Block-a slum on the outskirts of Auckland, New Zealand\\'s largest and most heavily populated metropolitan area-Once Were Warriors depicts the \\\\\"harrowing vision\\\\\" of one Maori community on the verge of extinction by poverty, abuse, and alcoholism. In portraying trauma\\'s simultaneous past and present presence, the novel offers readers an opportunity to bear witness to post-event generations dwelling both outside and inside of colonial trauma.A prolonged, chronic trauma like colonization involves \\\\\"a history of subjection to totalitarian control\\\\\" informed by and resulting in genocide (Herman, Trauma and Recovery 121). According to the United Nations, genocide is \\\\\"any act committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, national, ethnic, racial or religious groups\\\\\" and can include killing, physically harming, and \\\\\"inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about physical destruction of the group in whole or in part\\\\\" (emphasis added, \\\\\"Genocide\\\\\").

Frankfurt/M.: Suhrkamp, 2000. 312pp. 12 Euro. This collection of essays based on papers given at a conference, \\\\\"Zur Historiographie des Holocaust: Hannah Arendt\\'s `Eichmann in Jerusalem\\' Revisited,\\\\\" at the Einstein Forum in Berlin 1996 reflects a variety of perspectives, a few of them yielding new insights and even fewer contributing to a more differentiating historiography of \\\\\"the Holocaust.\\\\\" Most of these essays document the enduring difficulties of many Jewish readers with Arendt\\'s New Yorker report on the Eichmann trial. Four decades after the book\\'s publication, Arendt\\'s lack of solidarity with \\\\\"the Jewish people\\\\\" as demonstrated by the \\\\\"heartless,\\\\\" \\\\\"cold,\\\\\" \\\\\"rationalistic,\\\\\" \\\\\"profoundly inappropriate\\\\\" stylistic and conceptual shape of her argumentation still seems a centrally important issue -- as the critical analysis of unquestioned solidarity was of central importance to Arendt\\'s political essayism. Seyla Benhabib\\'s \\\\\"Identitat, Perspektive und Erzahlung in Hannah Arendts Eichmann in Jerusalem\\\\\" sharply criticizes Arendt for the confusing stylistic and conceptual hypercomplexity of her discussion of Eichmann\\'s particular criminality and its inherent moral dilemma: the common man and uncommon murderer. Somehow, Eichmann is not worth Arendt\\'s attention because Benhabib is not interested in Arendt\\'s emphasis on understanding and then possibly learning from a historical catastrophe rather than preserving it in ritualized collective memory. Dan Diner\\'s \\\\\"Hannah Arendt Reconsidered: Uber das Banale und das Bose in ihrer Holocaust-Erzahlung\\\\\" laments her lack of sympathy for East European Jews and the predominantly East European narrative of the Holocaust, and her \\\\\"thoughtless and reckless\\\\\" accusations of Judenrate (p. 120). Complaining about her alleged tendency to blur the distinction between perpetrator and victim (pp. 122f.), Diner denounces the values of the \\\\\"Vernunftzionistin\\\\\" Arendt as \\\\\"abstract, universal, institutional and therefore republican\\\\\" that prevent her from feeling one with (or even close to) the Jewish people as an ethnic entity (pp. 124f.). The general issue of unquestioning Jewish solidarity in reaction to the trauma of Nazi persecution has had a profound impact on its historiography. Annette Wieviorka\\'s argument in \\\\\"Die Entstehung des Zeugen\\\\\" is very important here and one of the few really useful contributions in its critical analysis of the implications of the chief prosecutor Gideon Hausner\\'s decision to base the dramatic structure of Eichmann\\'s trial on the stories of witnesses rather than the Nazi documents gathered by the Israeli police. He chose them on the basis of their already recorded testimonies and his subsequent interviews with them and choreographed for the \\\\\"stage of the world\\\\\" their presenting Jewish collective identity in the experience of Nazi persecution, extreme and therefore \\\\\"unique\\\\\" Jewish victimization. Hausner\\'s assumption had been that this experience could only become \\\\\"real\\\\\" for the millions of readers, listeners, and viewers if a large number of survivors testified in person and thereby \\\\\"individualized\\\\\" the sameness of unspeakable persecution. In the act of recitation, however, these stories would not draw on memories \\\\\"refreshed\\\\\" by the witnesses\\' previously recorded written testimonies as Hausner had hoped. Rather, the stories told by the witnesses at the trial became their memories (pp. 146f.). These memory stories and the modalities of \\\\\"performing\\\\\" them caused the presence of the witnesses to overwhelm and obscure the presence of the defendant Eichmann. One observer noted that the witnesses were \\\\\"the authorized delegates of the Holocaust, they were the facts\\\\\" (p. 150). There were very few critical voices like Arendt\\'s that would question the claims made by the organizers of the show trial with respect to its authority to write the history of the persecutions, of that total war, of the twentieth century, of modernity, of mankind. Wieviorka points out rightly that the Eichmann trial \\\\\"set free the language of the witnesses,\\\\\" helping them to \\\\\"achieve their social identity as survivors,\\\\\" and the core of this identity was the, as if predestined, calamitous course of history (pp. \\\\u2026\", \"year\": 2003}, {\"paperId\": \"f6dd35f695d094a86f984c72a816bae8aac0a844\", \"title\": \"Coping Action Patterns in Trauma and Other Autobiographic Narratives in Holocaust survivors: A Mixed\\\\u2013Methods Study\", \"abstract\": \"ABSTRACT In a world where genocides and wars are constant reality, understanding the long-term psychological impact of massive trauma on survivors, as well as identifying ways to promote resilience among them are crucial.

The latter wanted to rehabilitate the organizational frameworks that had been liquidated, while many among the surviving youth joined the kibbutzim, even though they were foreign to them from all perspectives, mainly because for them the kibbutzim served as the most appropriate alternative to the family that was lost. A number of articles in the book are devoted to describing the circumstances regarding the collection of testimonies from children and adolescents immediately after the war, and analyzing the difficulties that accompanied them. How was the world of children during the Holocaust presented? What did they remember and what was repressed? How did the adults treat their testimony and how did they interpret it? Questions of this type raised in the context of the nature of the testimonies of Holocaust survivors in general are reinforced when they relate to children and adolescents. Joanna Michilc, who specializes in research on children in the Holocaust (see her Jewish Children in Nazi Occupied Poland, Yad Vashem, 2008), has thoroughly analyzed the difficulties that historians and other researchers have in analyzing these testimonies.

The concept of relevance lies at the heart of intellectual access and information retrieval, indeed of reasoning and communication in general; in turn, topical relevance lies at the heart of relevance. The common view of topical relevance is limited to topic matching, resulting in information retrieval systems\\' failure to detect more complex topical connections which are needed to respond to diversified user situations and tasks. Method. Based on the role a piece of information plays in the overall structure of an argument, we have identified four topical relevance types: Direct, Indirect (circumstantial), Context, and Comparison. In the process of creating a speech retrieval test collection, graduate history students made 27,000 topical relevance assessments between Holocaust survivor interview segments and real user topics, using the four relevance types, each on a scale of 0 - 4. They recorded justifications for their assessments and kept detailed Topic Notes. Analysis. We analysed these relevance assessments using a grounded theory approach to arrive at a finer classification of topical relevance types. Results. For example, indirect relevance(a piece of information is connected to the topic indirectly through inference, circumstantial evidence) was refined to Generic Indirect Relevance, Backward Inference (abduction), Forward Inference (deduction), and Inference from Cases (induction), with each subtype being further illustrated and explicated by examples. Conclusion. Each of these refined types of topical relevance plays a special role in reasoning, making a conclusive argument, or performing a task. Incorporating them into information retrieval systems allows users more flexibility and a better focus on their tasks.

Drawing from a rich menu of interviews with prominent musicians, scholars, critics, and Holocaust survivors, Nupen presents an intriguing investigation of music\\\\u2019s power and meaning. We Want the Light originated as an hour-long 2003 special for the BBC. The 2009 two-DVD set begins with that BBC special, a well-crafted documentary which falls into three parts: 1) German history and Jewish assimilation; 2) Richard Wagner\\\\u2019s influence; and 3) the fallout from Hitler\\\\u2019s adoption of Wagner. Nupen tells this story through interviews, musical performances, and primary source readings. Underscoring it all are extended excerpts from various composers ranging from Bach to Brahms to Franz Waxman. Nupen covers a lot of historical ground and manages to find the right balance of scholarly context, musical reflection, and colorful (often heartbreaking) anecdotes from the survivors. The images throughout We Want the Light are mainly of the interviewees, but Nupen also incorporates excellent live performance footage, most of which effectively focuses our attention on the music rather than the technique or personality of the performer(s). Also included is a rare clip from a concert in Rishon LeZion, Israel in which the Israel Symphony attempts to perform Wagner\\\\u2019s Siegfried Idyll over the protests of an angry listener shaking a rattle. Nupen concludes the first DVD by presenting the entire documentary soundtrack again but without interviews or narration; the images here are drawn almost completely from live performances. As Nupen notes in the DVD introduction, the documentary repeatedly emphasizes music\\\\u2019s ability to communicate more vividly than words. The separate music track, recorded in Dolby Digital 5.1, is intended to encourage viewers to return to the music itself and reflect on the context We Want the Light has just described. On the second DVD, Nupen presents extended clips from the eighteen interviews he conducted for the documentary. Included is a stunning performance by Evgeny Kissin, whose interview did not make the final cut, but whose playing of the slow movement from Brahms Piano Sonata in F minor, Op. 5 powerfully captures Nupen\\\\u2019s overarching point that music, though abstract and imprecise, has the ability to cut deep into our emotional being. This is Nupen\\\\u2019s tenth documentary, all now available on DVD. His earlier projects focused on performers (Segovia, Kissin, Perlman, du Pr\\\\u00e9, Milstein, Ashkenazy), or composers (Schubert and Sibelius), so We Want the Light cuts a new path, and in doing so confirms Nupen\\\\u2019s mastery of the classical music documentary.

This study deals with a case study of one of the constitutive historical events of the 20th century: commemoration of the Holocaust. The study focuses on the Experiential Learning Method of educating about Holocaust remembrance and commemoration and about Holocaust monuments. Over the years memorial centers have been added, which contain additional monuments commemorating the story of a specific place and/or personal stories. One of the currently customary methods of commemoration in Israel is the journey to Poland, to the labor, concentration, and death camps, to the various memorial sites and monuments. This journey is undertaken by young and old, groups and singles, from all over the world and particularly from Israel. Since many of those taking the journey are young people at an age when personal, national, and historical identity is formed, a time when the young acquire their educational values, it is particularly important to ascertain who is charged with passing on the beacon of memory. This leads to weighty questions regarding the identity of the guides who lead these journeys and the contents they choose to impart to the participants, the guidance sites, and the method of guidance. Who will tell the story? How will the story be told? What will remain of the story? This study discusses in addition, a case study of guides from Israel charged with imparting this chapter of human history. In order to explore their impact, interviews were held with 47 guides, the large majority of whom are Israeli born, a majority academics, and many hold advanced degrees. The research findings indicate that they aim the commemoration beacon primarily at guidance sites in Poland. The study explored other diverse essential parameters regarding the profile of \\\\u201cguides to Poland\\\\u201d \\\\u2013 where did they study? What is their personal affiliation with the subject? What is their position on the universal and Jewish narrative of the Holocaust? In light of the interviews conducted, it appears that almost all of them have the necessary tools to convey the most complete and comprehensive educational message. Accordingly, this issue was explored and most of the guides reported that the most influential message of commemoration is conveyed primarily through visits to camps and ghettos in Poland. This conclusion generates a theoretical, practical, philosophical, moral, and educational question indicating the \\\\u201cexporting of historical memory\\\\u201d. Should our entire educational focus indeed be exclusively on Poland? How can we preserve the ethos of the affiliation between the Holocaust of the Jews and heroism in the Holocaust, as well as heroism in Israel and its building, if we disregard the many commemoration and memorial sites within Israel? Do the journeys to the camps and to the valley of death in Poland, which are led by these guides, not create a distortion in the instilling of Holocaust remembrance and heritage, by disregarding the many commemoration sites and monuments throughout Israel? Aiming the beacon of commemoration at Poland, outside Israel, prevents exposure of the public, and particularly teenagers, to the natural association formed in Israel between Holocaust and revival, which preserves the connecting link between the generations.\", \"year\": 2022}, {\"paperId\": \"f9bc1a8e4ef19fbc17f06457ef43db2d0dc34bde\", \"title\": \"When Is an Interview an Interview?

So in effect many cancer patients constrict their fantasy, affect, and feeling, almost withdrawing emotionally, and externalize their feelings such as by blaming everything and everyone else such as doctors who made a delayed or wrong diagnosis, the hospital, the family, an injury that they believe caused the cancer, etc. Bahnson goes on to present his observations on a few patients that he has seen who suffered both types of trauma, holocaust survivors, who in recent years developed cancer. He showed that these patients had first to deal with the \\\\\"unfinished business\\\\\" of true mourning, with all the rage and frustration that had never really been expressed towards their persecutors in the war, before they could begin to deal with the present threat of anihilation from their own bodies. That paper is followed by another clear and well-written paper from Hertz on \\\\\"Homesickness and Psychosomatic Disease\\\\\", and after that it is predominantly downhill. A series of papers on Anorexia Nervosa by the Touyz group from Australia is disappointing from a country that is usually associated with higher quality work. In one of their papers, on patients\\' impressions of their own body image via various test procedures, the authors note that \\\\\"none of the control subjects was able to judge herself accurately\\\\\"! This lends some confirmation towards a clinical impression that I have long held and found quite useful in confrontation in psychotherapy, that almost all women do not see themselves accurately, though most do not take it to the extent of the distortion of the anorexic. Heigl-Evers and Rosin try to compare a traditional psychoanalytic interview with what they call an interactional approach, and offer us some hypothesized dialogue that more resembles a parody or comedy skit than a patient being interviewed by a competent dynamic psychotherapist. Doerr-Zegers et al. in attempting to analyze some family data in Anorexia Nervosa demonstrate one really important finding in their observations on a limited number of patients. In 18 out oftheir 20 patients the onset of Anorexia Nervosa was preceded by what they described as a \\\\\"striking life event\\\\\", such as illness or death of a parent, or even a failure on the part of the patient to succeed in a significant endeavour such as an examination. Ramsay writes a good review of the topic of pain, but unfortunately the book is brought to an end by three very weak papers from Greek authors looking at Psychosomatic aspects in the year 2000. Psychotherapy and Psychosomatic Medicine have not usually been considered to be areas in which progress has been rapid and dramatic and therefore the fact that this congress took place more than four years ago is not necessarily a deterrent to perusing this book. Any reader should find something of value, but I doubt that anyone will be overly impressed with the standard as a whole. I suspect that most of the contributors are research psychiatrists and that many do very little or no psychotherapy themselves. To say then that this is the \\\\\"state of the art\\\\\" in terms of these areas of clinical psychiatry would not be fair, certainly not in the North American context. To suggest that this is the \\\\\"state of the art\\\\\" in terms of research psychiatry may also not be quite accurate from our North American perspective, but there is certainly the possibility that this book reflects the \\\\\"state of the art\\\\\" in terms of work in many other countries, and that in itself is worthy of our attention.\", \"year\": 1988}, {\"paperId\": \"fa1bf57985de2aacb34f3a8168460e963b2445af\", \"title\": \"The Collective Memory Reader\", \"abstract\": \"PREFACE AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS INTRODUCTION: JEFFREY K.

The countless number of lives lost during World War II and the displacement of millions from their native lands are among the most tragic events in the history of the twentieth century. According to experts, the past century proved to be the most violent and the bloodiest one hundred years in human history, an assertion convincingly substantiated by scholars, researchers, and journalists who have published scores of books and articles about civilian and military victims of both world wars. Special emphasis has been put on victims of the Second World War, * The essay, which has been partly updated, has already been published on S. B. Várdy T.H. Tooley A. H. Várdy, Ethnic Cleansing in Twentieth-Century Europe, Columbia University Press, New York 2003, pp. 503-516. ** Agnes Huszár Várdy, Ph.D. is a former Professor of Communications and Literature at Robert Morris University and currently Adjunct Professor in the English Department at Duquesne University. She is the author, co-author, and co-editor of eight volumes and over eighty-five articles and essays, among them two books on Austro-German Romanticism, more specifically on two Romantic poets, Nikolaus Lenau and Karl Beck, and a social-historical novel, Mimi, used in history and literature courses at several American universities. A few years ago, along with her husband, Dr. Steven B. Várdy of the Dept. of History at Duquesne University, she began to do research on forced labor camps, known as the Gulag, in the former Soviet Union. Two of their books have already appeared on the subject: Stalin’s Gulag: the Hungarian Experience (Oriental University, Naples, 2007) pp. 203 and Magyarok a Gulag Rabszolgatáboraiban [Hungarians in Gulag Slave Labor Agnes Huszár Várdy DEP n.7 / 2007 89 especially Hitler’s crusade against the Jewish population in the countries occupied by the Third Reich. Efforts to inform the general public about the horrors of the Jewish Holocaust have been especially successful and have led to widespread knowledge about these events among practically all the nations of the world. This level of historical awareness does not exist for most other ethnic groups and nationalities whose lives were adversely affected by World War II. Millions of non-Jews were forced to endure previously unheard of deprivation and hardship, before, during, and after the war. Compared to the extensive investigation of the Jewish Holocaust, historical research has paid little attention to the lot of other victimized groups. Relatively little has been written about them, and as a result, these events have failed to become common knowledge. The fate of those who fled their native lands in Eastern and Central Europe in fear of the invading Soviet Army, and later settled in Western Europe, or immigrated to North or South America, has not been adequately researched. Not much is known about the victims of forced population expulsions and ethnic cleansing, such as the sixteen million Germans who were expelled from Poland and Czechoslovakia (from former East and West Prussia, Pomerania, Silesia and the Sudetenland). In the same vein, with the exception of Hungarian scholars, the general public is not aware of the retribution suffered by about 120,000 ethnic Hungarians who were driven across the Danube from Slovakia to Hungary as a consequence of the Beneš Decrees.

Naimark, Fires of Hatred: Ethnic Cleansing in Twentieth-Century Europe, Cambridge, Mass., 2001. 2 One of the most authoritative standard works (among many hundreds) on the Jewish Holocaust is still Raul Hilberg’s The Destruction of the European Jewry, Chicago, 1961. See also the highly regarded work on the largest death camp, Debórah Dwork and Robert Jan van Pelt, Auschwitz: 1270 to the Present, New York, 1996. On the Hungarian segment of the Jewish Holocaust, see Randolph L. Graham’s massive synthesis, The Politics of Genocide: The Holocaust in Hungary, 2 vols., New York, 1981; and Randolph L. Braharn and Béla Vágó eds., The Holocaust in Hungary Forty Years Later, New York, 1985. A classic Hungarian-language summary is Jenõ Lévai, Zsidósors Magyarországon [Jewish Fate in Hungary], Budapest, 1948. See also the documentary collection: Vádirat a nácizmus ellen.

According to Barrel, originally 73.187 Hungarians were slated for expulsion on the basis of the parity list. An additional 106.398 were to be expelled as “major war criminals” and 1.927 as “minor war criminals”. Had this been implemented a total of 181.512 would have been expelled. But the Czechoslovak government was not satisfied even with these numbers. It turned to the Peace Conference and demanded approval for expulsion of an additional 200.000 Hungarians. These goals, however, were not allowed to be implemented, and thus by April 10, 1948, only 68.407 Hungarians were officially resettled in Hungary. Continued illegal expulsions, however, almost doubled this number, for according to the Hungarian census of 1949 at least 119.000 of these expellees were living in Hungary. Cf. I. Romsics, Magyarország története a XX. században [Hungary’s History in the Twentieth Century], Budapest 1999, p. 302. Agnes Huszár Várdy DEP n.7 / 2007 90 million of his own “compatriots”, including Russians and many other ethnic groups and nationalities, is limited. His victims included Poles, Ukrainians, Baltic peoples, Crimean Tatars, and many others who were exterminated by the millions. Yet, knowledge about the fate of these peoples is not widespread, at least not, to the extent to which the horrors of the Jewish Holocaust has permeated the historical consciousness of the broader public. It is evident that the victims of war and prejudice, misery, and extermination mentioned above have not attracted the same degree of interest of experts, researchers, and journalists. As a result, a gigantic gap of public ignorance and misinformation exists regarding these shocking events, both in Europe and the United States. The lives and fate of foreign victims of Soviet forced labour camps also falls into the category of “the little known”. Insofar as historically aware individuals in Western Europe and North America have given the whole issue any thought, most have assumed that only POWs and members of the armed forces of the defeated nations were deported to the Soviet Union after World War II. This assumption could not be further from the truth. In the case of Hungary, it was only after the demise of Communism in 1989-1990 that researchers, journalists, and political leaders could begin to focus on the fate of the several hundred-thousand Hungarian civilians, including innocent women and children, who were deported to forced labour camps after the Soviet invasion of Hungary in September 1944. It is virtually impossible to uncover the full details about these deportations, but the publication of several studies based on memoirs, diaries, and interviews of survivors provides a vast amount of information that contributes substantially to our knowledge of these tragic events. These include published works by Tamás Stark, György Dupka, Péter Rózsa, Janos Rózsás, Zoltán Szente, Mihály Herczeg, and Zsolt Csalog; the memoirs of Imre Badzey and Mrs. Sándor Mészáros; and the documentary films of Sándor Sára and the Gulyás brothers.

I examine how these short and long-term effects can extend into adulthood using an auto/biographical methodology; from a perspective influenced by my own encounters as a corporal punishment survivor from Nepal. \\n \\nCorporal punishment continues to be used in Nepalese schools, with the support of many teachers, parents and school management committees, despite several government policy initiatives and court rulings against it. In contrast to worldwide developments (notably in Scandinavia and America), research into corporal punishment in Nepal tends to be rare, quantitative and focused upon the prevalence and short-term effects as described by group participants and newspaper articles. This study addresses the urgent need to increase public awareness, using personal accounts describing the long-term outcomes of corporal punishment, with a depth of detail facilitated by an auto/biographical research methodology. Participants in the study expressed feelings of relief and increased self-understanding, although for myself at least, these were accompanied by feelings of grief and confusion. \\n \\nThe lives of five corporal punishment survivors are explored through a series of interviews carried out in the Devchuli municipality of Nawalparasi, Nepal, between November 2015 and January 2016. The first is my own story, the second is a pilot interview and the other three are discussed under the themes of immediate compliance, severing dichotomies, disempowered bodies and the spiritual threat of spatio-temporal appropriation. \\n \\nThe participants, whose identities are protected, look back, as adults, upon their experiences of corporal punishment at school and consider possible links between these and their current social, political, economic and spiritual challenges. Simultaneously, the study questions whether ‘effects’ can ever be conceptually or temporally contained within ‘multi-faceted’ and ‘becoming’ identities, using examples from the participants’ self-appraisals. \\n \\nI examine literature from the global debate on the effects of corporal punishment upon children, including the contrasting methodologies of Murray Straus, Alice Miller and Elizabeth Gershoff. The impact of corporal punishment upon notions of personhood is explored using Theodor Adorno’s interpretation of reification and comparable notions of objectification challenged by Andrea Dworkin, Martha Nussbaum and Paolo Freire. Corporal punishment is discussed in relation to power, conflict and the Holocaust, using Adorno and Bauman’s descriptions of authoritarian behaviours and immediate compliance, and Nietzsche and Foucault’s notions of punishment as a spectacle. Conditions for the possibility of corporal punishment are located to traditions deifying teachers, judgement-based belief systems and neo-liberal ideologies of competition and performativity. These are contrasted with alternative, non-punitive pedagogical and theological resources. Participants explore the ways in which healing and holistic self-development can be blocked by everyday vocabularies of violence and conditionality, triggering destructive individual and collective over-determined reactions. \\n \\nMy study ‘concludes’ with reflections upon how corporal punishment has affected my participants’ lives: with their social roles hampered by defensive masks and evasive dances; their political lives blocked by fears of punishment; their economic lives stilted by caution and low self-esteem and their spiritual lives distorted by disenchantment and disappointment. Methodology and theory converge as my study rejects inherently disciplinarian, Enlightenment-led demands fo**r rational or scientific ‘proof’ of psychological effects, by presenting auto/biography itself, especially ‘child-standpoint’ narratives, as valid revolutionary praxis, effervescent with resistance to punitive ideologies and practices and dedicated to the liberation of our present from a painful past.', 'year': 2017}, {'paperId': '03af20b0f65018bc19dbb20b540e31455fb856e7', 'title': 'The Lifelong Process of Holocaust Survival: How Miriam Reich Rebuilt her Life', 'abstract': \"The overarching theme of this article is that the personal is historical and vice versa.

Montague Antioch University Seattle It is now well known that six million Jews, 220,000 Roma, 250,000 disabled persons, and thousands of Homosexuals and Jehovah’s witnesses were murdered in the Holocaust. It is less understood that due to their ethnic identity that approximately, 1. 9 million Polish Catholic citizens were murdered during the Holocaust and that 1.7 million Polish non-Jews were imprisoned in concentration camps in Siberia, 2.0 million were deported as forced laborers for the German Reich and 100,000 were killed in Auschwitz. To date, there are no studies within Western psychology that address the effects of the Holocaust for this population and/or their descendants. Given the known after-effects of Holocaust-related trauma for Jewish Holocaust survivors and their families, the trauma response observed in other genocide survivors, and the lack of psychological research aimed at exploring the experience of non-Jewish Holocaust survivors, there is a need to study the lived experience and effects of Holocaust-related trauma with Polish Catholic survivors and their families. This is an interpretative study that explores the lived experience of six Polish Catholic survivors and their descendants. The sample included 12 participants comprised of six survivors, four second generation and two third generation participants.

Fast (review)\", 'abstract': 'A landmark moment in Holocaust history and memory occurred in 1989 when about 1,000 Kindertransport survivors attended their 50-year reunion in London. The event commemorated the transport of 10,000 children from Central Europe to safety in Britain. Launched on November 9, 1938, the transport continued for a year until the Nazis ended it when war was declared in September 1939. Before they began to share their memories of the transport, few had thought of themselves as Holocaust survivors. After all, they had escaped the round-ups and deportations that began shortly after November 9, 1938, when the Nazis orchestrated Kristallnacht (night of broken glass), the nation-wide pogrom against the Jews, their synagogues, and businesses. None of these child refugees had suffered the ghettoes or camps. They were not among the children who had been hidden with non-Jewish families or in convents, and they did not pass as Aryans with forged identity papers. And yet, as Vera Fast discovered in interviews, memoirs, and archives, despite being rescued, those 10,000 children did not escape the effects of the Holocaust. Almost all the children’s parents had been killed. For the younger children, this would mean that in addition to losing their parents, they would have no memory of them to mourn. For the older children, memories could be fleeting or remain as excruciating reminders of their loss. Of the few parents who survived, the trauma of separation was exacerbated when reunions were painful. However, despite these losses and pain, almost all of the Kinder grew up to have successful careers and rich personal lives, and they remained unequivocally grateful to the nation that saved them. Yet as memoirs and interviews reveal, their experiences were also complicated by the process of adapting linguistically and socially to an alien culture and society that did not always understand the emotional needs and religious customs of these Jewish children. Their story of rescue and adaptation is crucial to our knowledge of the Holocaust as it represents another facet of the intricate and global reach of Hitler’s designs to persecute and exterminate the Jewish people.', 'year': 2013}, {'paperId': '09762167e502e1e1aa170f503aebd524198d02c3', 'title': 'Witness Theater: A Film Review Bridging the Generational Gap: Connecting Aging Trauma Survivors with Teens', 'abstract': 'ABSTRACT This film review examines the documentary Witness Theater directed by Oren Rudavsky.

New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004. 212 pp. $65.00 In recent years there has been a dramatic increase in publishing on the topic of children and the Holocaust. Scholarship has focused on the historical experiences of children during the Holocaust, the diaries they kept, the emotional legacy of child survivors, the retelling of their life stories, the treatment of the Holocaust in children\\'s literature, and more. My own book, Imaging the Child in Modern Jewish Fiction (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), highlighted writing by Jerzy Kosinski, Aharon Appelfeld, and David Grossman as I explored representations of consciousness and the depiction of children\\'s points of view in adult literary texts. That study drew on Bakhtin\\'s theories of the \"dialogic imagination,\" noting that polyphony is inescapable in texts that mediate children\\'s voices through adult narration or editing. In Children Writing the Holocaust, Sue Vice works with a similar set of assumptions and analytical tools to examine a wide range of authors and types of publications. She sets herself two main goals. The first is to identify a series of narrative features distinctive to texts, aimed at an adult readership, that deal with a child\\'s-eye view of the Holocaust. The second goal is to determine whether there is substantial literary material that treats the Holocaust from a child\\'s perspective. This book is at its finest in the skillful stylistic analyses it offers. Vice scrutinizes an impressive array of texts, bringing a sharp interpretive eye and nuanced readings to a variety of memoirs, autobiographical fictions, diaries, and more. Among the writers she considers are well-known figures such as Saul Friedlander (When Memory Comes) and Georges Perec (W or the Memory of Childhood), as well as numerous others who have received less recognition and critical attention. She discerns the following elements in much of this writing: \"Defamiliarization; errors of fact and perception; attention to detail at the expense of context; loss of affect; indefinite or divided temporality; irony of various kinds; the confusion of developmental with historical events; charged relations between author, narrator and protagonist; and age-specific concerns with the nature of writing and memory\" (p. 2). Relying on Bakhtin as her central theoretical model, Vice weighs how narrative strategies and narrative structures convey personal and historical trauma in this literary corpus. In the process she makes many good observations. Of note is the discussion of fragmentary narration, a kind of storytelling that combines detail with historical gaps. Of special interest, too, are diaries. As she rightly points out, this category of writing has, till now, received too little formal, stylistic analysis. A particularly fascinating topic is choral narration-a phenomenon found in fiction, biography, and autobiographical texts that express collective experiences. Examples cited here include Karen Gershon\\'s We Came as Children, a compilation of children\\'s remarks based on a series of interviews; Henryk Grynberg\\'s Children of Zion, an anthology of testimonies; and Clara Asscher-Pinkhoff\\'s Star Children, a collection of short stories. Vice is consistently excellent at teasing apart the components of narrative voice and pointing out ways in which Bakhtin\\'s ideas of dialogic discourse illuminate the literature at hand. Regrettably, for a study that focuses so intelligently on dialogics, Children Writing the Holocaust does not always engage adequately in dialogue with other scholarship. Vice is well versed in Holocaust studies, but her book does not deal sufficiently with work that takes parallel approaches to narratives of childhood and adolescence. She does not, for example, engage with my book, other than to list it in a bibliography. Had she been more in conversation with the ideas expressed there, she might have dealt more satisfactorily with the question of distinctiveness in the material she analyzes. …', 'year': 2006}, {'paperId': '0d4c97305019a796b1bd885971518bb53e0e787b', 'title': 'Invited Talk: Lessons from the MALACH Project: Applying New Technologies to Improve Intellectual Access to Large Oral History Collections', 'abstract': \"In this talk I will describe the goals of the MALACH project (Multilingual Access to Large Spoken Archives) and our research results.

New York: Schocken Books, 2005. 274 pp. $25.00. On April 15, 1945, British tanks rumbled up to the barbed wire fence surrounding the concentration camp of Bergen-Belsen. The soldiers climbed out of their tanks, walked up to the wire, and peered through it. One by one, they began to vomit. The overpowering stench of countless corpses rotting in the sun, and the ghastly sight of skeletal survivors was an unimaginable experience even for these battle-hardened veterans. They were the first Allied eyewitnesses to what later became known as the Holocaust. After Daybreak is a vivid, gripping account of what happened after the British opened the gates of Bergen-Belsen. Never before had an army encountered such a catastrophic medical emergency. Bergen-Belsen was, in effect, a small city of 60,000 brutalized, starving, and typhus-ridden inhabitants. How the British doctors, nurses, medical students, clergymen, and other volunteers struggled to save the lives of the survivors is the focus of Ben Shephard\\'s superb book. Shephard is an Emmy Award-winning documentary filmmaker, the preeminent historian of military psychiatry, and the author of the magisterial A War of Nerves (Harvard University Press, 2001). Letters, diaries, interviews, and military documents provided Shephard with the raw material to reconstruct how the British coped with this unprecedented medical crisis in the days and weeks following the liberation of the camp. The story is one of trial, error, and eventual success. Approximately 14,000 inmates died after liberation, and about 2,000 perished after receiving food far too rich for them to digest. Medical personnel failed to realize that ravenous bodies adapted to starvation conditions cannot initially withstand a normal diet. One of the most heart-rending tasks was deciding who would get a chance to live and who would be left to die. Resources were limited, and not everyone could be saved. Nightly staff meetings, fortified by alcohol, kept the exhausted doctors sane and focused on their mission. After several weeks, the situation began to improve, and the mortality rate declined. As more survivors regained their health, glimmers of normal life began to emerge. Inmates obtained musical instruments and held concerts and dances. One Red Cross relief worker wrote home saying that\"Belsen is very gay, parties and internee concerts every night.\" One of the most remarkable and bizarre episodes occurred when a large shipment of lipstick mysteriously arrived at the camp. The overworked doctors were initially annoyed because they were expecting desperately needed medical supplies. …', 'year': 2008}, {'paperId': '0fb569f6d94b3d74a8d0b73e6b68a4a6e212a60a', 'title': 'How to teach the Holocaust', 'abstract': 'Anxious Histories is a micro-historical analysis of the ways in which teachers in Jewish day schools in two major urban centres in the western world approach the subject of the Holocaust history in their curricula. Focussing on five schools in Melbourne, Australia, and seven schools in New York City, Jordana Silverstein analyses how teachers pass the ‘knowledge’ of the history of the Holocaust on the children and young students. As the author explains, this is not ‘a longitudinal study of Holocaust education: this is more a snapshot, or a glimpse at an archive captured at one year [2006] in time’ (p. 5). Anchored in comprehensive theoretical discussions and evaluations of up-to-date Holocaust historiography, the analysis offers a close reading of supplied curricula (from seven schools) and interviews with teachers, conducted by the author. In the main argument, Silverstein posits that the development of the teaching approaches is shaped and reshaped by the Jews’ anxieties about their current position in non-Jewish societies worldwide, but also by their relations with Zionism, which is often understood in very broad and unclear terms, such as support for the State of Israel (101). Silverstein covers a whole range of topics throughout the book, including but not limited to the structure of the individual curricula, the use of survivors’ testimonies and survivors’ visits in the classroom, the question of memory and ‘deep memory’ in the curriculum and Holocaust historiography at large, the settler-colonial (US and Australia) and Zionist influences on the teaching, and the question of gender and the representation of women. As she consistently argues, the particular modes in which the teachers narrate these topics are all shaped by the underlining efforts to manage their own anxieties about the Jews’ position in the society and ‘to determine identity formations in a situation which requires the negotiation of feeling of displacement and the accompanying anxieties’ (87). The teachers desperately want to be part of the cultures and nations they live in (and they wish the same for their students), but in their classes dealing with violence and the Jewish genocide, they are continuously reminded about the uncertain position of the Jews in the world and thus – perhaps unconsciously as Silverstein posits – vent their anxieties in the ways in which they construct the courses on Holocaust histories (208). The whole monograph is nicely written and is engaging, though I could not avoid the feeling that many of the conclusions and interpretations of the primary sources offered by Silverstein are often speculative.

Cuba welcomed immigrants long after the United States shut its doors to them in 1924, particularly refugees from Nazism. Yet the story of Cuban Jewry also includes the tragic 1939 drama of the SS St. Louis, turned away from Havana and the United States with its cargo of German-Jewish refugees still aboard, a propaganda coup for Germany. Although many Jews prospered economically on the island, they always remained outsiders, denied access to political influence and to high society. Unlike Jewish communities elsewhere, Jews in Cuba played virtually no cultural or intellectual role. Ironically, those who emigrated to the United States as politically (and economically) desirable refugees after the 1959 revolution were the same Jews, or the children of the same Jews, who had been deemed undesirable and denied U.S. entry in the 1920s. Robert Levine interviewed nearly a hundred Cuban-Jewish immigrants in the course of writing this book, and his use of their words lends the work an especially engaging, lively quality and makes it a vivid reflection of how the immigrants thought and felt and lived. The pages contain more than seventy-five rare photographs of the island and of the Jewish community from its origins to its near-moribund state today. Levine also compares the experience of Cuba's Jews with that of other immigrant groups, as well as that of Holocaust survivors in other Caribbean and Central American countries. The book's broad scope thus gives it appeal not only for students of Latin American Jewish issues but for all those interested in the relationship between majority and minoritysocieties in the Americas.\", 'year': 1993}, {'paperId': '104794dedc0048cad4a0e5ff3360580b5add7cb8', 'title': 'Art History', 'abstract': 'The study of art history encompasses the visual art, architecture, and material culture of a wide range of regions and historical periods.

He describes a lively debate that began after the group watched the taped testimony of a woman who was an eyewitness to the Auschwitz uprising in which prisoners set fire to the camp. The woman reported four chimneys going up in flames and exploding, but historians insisted that since there was only one chimney blown up, her testimony was incorrect and should be discredited in its entirety because she proved herself an unreliable witness. One historian suggested that her testimony should be discounted because she \"ascribes importance to an attempt that, historically, made no difference\" (Felman 1992, 61 ). The psychoanalysts responded that the woman was not testifying to the number of chimneys blown up but to something more \"radical\" and more \"crucial,\" namely, the seemingly unimaginable occurrence of Jewish resistance at Auschwitz, that is to say, the historical truth of Jewish resistance at Auschwitz. Laub concludes that what the historians could not hear, listening for empirical facts, was the \"very secret of survival and of resistance to extermination\" (Felman 1992, 62). While the historians were listening to hear confirmation of what they already knew, the psychoanalysts where listening to hear something new, something beyond comprehension. While the historians were trying to recognize empirical facts in the survivors\\' testimonies, the psychoanalysts were trying to acknowledge that the import of these testimonies was unrecognizable. Although undeniably powerful in their impact, the empirical facts of the Holocaust are dead to that which cannot be reported by the eye-witness, the unseen in vision and the unspoken in speech, that which is beyond recognition in history, the process of witnessing itself. In this essay, I want to elaborate a notion of witnessing as an alternative to recognition as a basis for subjectivity. Witnessing is defined as the action of bearing witness or giving testimony, the fact of being present and observing something, from witness which is defined as to bear witness, to testify, to give evidence, to be a spectator or auditor of something, to be present as an observer, to see with one\\'s own eyes (OED, 3904). It is important to note that witnessing has both the juridical connotations of seeing with one\\'s own eyes and the religious connotations of testifying to that which cannot be seen, or bearing witness. It is this double meaning that makes witnessing such a powerful alternative to recognition in formulating identity and ethical relations. Contemporary theory is still dominated by conceptions of identity or subjectivity that inherit a Hegelian notion of recognition. In various ways, these theories describe how we recognize ourselves in our likeness as the same or in opposition to what is (or those who are) different from ourselves. Relations with others are described as struggles for recognition. But, if we start from the assumption that relations are essentially antagonistic struggles for recognition, then it is no wonder that contemporary theorists spend so much energy trying to imagine how these struggles can lead to compassionate personal relations, ethical social relations, or democratic political relations. From the presumption that human relations are essentially warlike, how can we imagine them as peaceful? In this essay, on the one hand, I challenge the Hegelian notion that subjectivity is the result of hostile conflict-Axel Honneth\\'s struggle for recognition or Judith Butler\\'s subordination that makes the subject\\'s turn inward possible. On the other hand, I challenge notions of subjectivity based on a logic of exclusion-Butler\\'s foreclosed object of desire or Julia Kristeva\\'s abject.

Rather, for many of them, discussion is generally connected to how or what they have explained to their children about their experiences during the war. Survivors’ preoccupation with this issue could be understood as a response to the context in which they find themselves, in which a particular social discourse about survivors has developed. This discourse arguably engendered particular responses from survivors: it is a question that survivors expect to be asked, and it is seen as part of their prescribed role. Based on over 50 narrative interviews with survivors of the Holocaust, this article explores how survivors reflect and understand their parenting. It examines to what extent their behaviour has been influenced by their experiences during the war, or in reaction to a particular social discourse.

Troubled Memory (Powell, 2000) traces the odyssey of Anne Skorecki Levy, a child survivor of the Lodz and Warsaw ghettos who immigrated with her family to New Orleans in 1949. Though the story line begins and ends in Louisiana, a place whose history I know well by virtue of teaching it, the book cuts a wide swath through prewar and wartime Poland and postwar Germany. There\\'s no question of my qualifications to research and write about the U.S. Civil War and Reconstruction-and southern history, generally. But modern European history? My training in that field is scant, my prior knowledge of the Holocaust rudimentary at best. So how is it that I wandered so far afield? The only answer I can offer is that Troubled Memory is not the book I set out to write. An unexpected encounter with survivor testimony pulled me off course. It began on a Sunday afternoon when a big-time literary agent telephoned me at home from California, saying I should write a book about the stop-Duke movement. The call came shortly after our rapscallion ex-Governor, Edwin Edwards, had defeated ex-Klansman David Duke in the high-turnout 1991 gubernatorial runoff election. Famously known as \"the race from hell,\" the campaign had attracted media attention from around the world. Because of my leadership in a political-action committee dedicated to exposing Duke\\'s neo-Nazi sympathies, reporters from print and broadcast media often sought me out for quotes and insights. The book agent thought that this national exposure would make it possible for me to write a successful book about how ordinary people had come together across racial and religious lines to defeat the threat Duke had posed to democratic decency and civility. She said big bucks were a distinct possibility; big prizes, too. I gave the suggestion hard thought for about thirty seconds before accepting. The subject certainly seemed important. Louisiana in the late 1980s and early \\'90s was facing a political threat unlike any other I had personally witnessed. Posing as a born-again Republican conservative, and exploiting the economic and moral anxieties arising simultaneously from the oil patch depression and New Orleans\\'s crack cocaine epidemic, David Duke had managed to garner between 600,000 and 700,000 white voters in two statewide elections, one for the U.S. Senate, the other for the governorship-an astonishing 55 percent to 60 percent of the white vote. Not only this, but he also caught the national conservative movement totally by surprise, hijacking Republican issues and raiding their funding base. Guilt-by-association fears that Duke might pull a hood over the head of every Republican in the country is probably why the first President Bush signed the 1991 Civil Rights bill. Bush pere badly needed to distance his party from the nouvelle Nazi who had crashed the party. My intention when I began the project was to capture the individual stones of how ordinary people had worked against type to bear witness against Duke and ultimately swamp him with a massive turnout. I knew the conventional wisdom was wrong: that economic self-preservation alone had caused the tidal wave, that voters were lashed by fears a Duke victory would ruin tourism and cause redlining of Louisiana\\'s businesses. I knew such explanations were half-truths. The election had unleashed a huge surge of ethical energy. It was evident in the way staid businessmen reached into their pockets to buy personal television testimonials, or National Guard commanders spoke out on camera in medal-laden uniforms. Even the author of our most famous bumper sticker- \"Vote for the Crook. It\\'s Important\" -conceded he was moved by profound moral concerns. Anne Levy was similarly stirred, and I planned on opening the book with an account of her well-publicized confrontation with recently elected State Representative David Duke in the rotunda of Huey Long\\'s skyscraper state capital. …', 'year': 2003}, {'paperId': '119b212980a199fa96b85deff8238cef5d0879f2', 'title': 'Biographical research methods', 'abstract': 'VOLUME ONE: TIME AND BIOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH PART ONE: \\'THE PLACE OF HISTORY\\' Uses of History -

Absent from previous research have been the viewpoints of older survivors themselves regarding their aged care experiences. An interpretive phenomenological approach was used to investigate Jewish Holocaust survivors’ lived experience of using community aged care services. Thirteen in-depth interviews were conducted and analysed using thematic analysis. The credibility of the findings was ensured by methodological triangulation and peer debriefing. Four major themes emerged from the analysis: wanting carers to do their job well; being supported to maintain autonomy; having a good relationship with the carer; and being understood as an individual. Although Holocaust survivors described the lived experience of using community aged care services in terms of universal themes similar to those identified with other groups of care recipients, the data revealed that this experience is intertwined with individual earlier-life traumatic experiences. This study has implications for training age care staff who work with Holocaust survivors and older trauma survivors from other refugee backgrounds.', 'year': 2019}, {'paperId': '139de006fefb0af40f0d1acfe8d0abd28e282c3f', 'title': 'EMOTIONAL MEMORIES OF FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS DURING THE HOLOCAUST', 'abstract': 'This article examines psychosocial aspects of family/parent-child relationships during the Holocaust by focusing on the emotional memories of such relationships. Global and thematic analyses were undertaken on 93 life story interviews and testimonies with Holocaust survivors. Results showed that survivors who lived through most of the war with parents/family and those who had lived approximately an equal time with loved ones and without them were able to recall and narrate more emotional memories, both positive and negative, than people who had experienced the traumatic period mostly on their own. However, going through the war with family did not guarantee the narration of emotional memories; close to half of these victims could not recall/narrate such memories. In general, when the survivor recalled relative emotional security, she or he felt safe, even when physical danger was imminent. However, this feeling did not always continue when the physical situation worsened or when the survivor was separated from loved ones. It was suggested that the ability to recall and narrate emotional memories highlights the heterogeneity in family relationships that existed during the Holocaust and the kinds of family relationships that developed after the Holocaust.', 'year': 2002}, {'paperId': '143feb434cd3d3be6f1bea1e0048f41b010994e9', 'title': 'The Trauma Trilogy of Catastrophic Grief, Survivor Guilt and Anger in Aging Child Holocaust Survivors', 'abstract': 'Abstract This article is based on a qualitative research study that explored the impact of trauma experienced by child Holocaust survivors who were interned in concentration camps for periods of time during their childhood/adolescence. A conceptual model of a traumatic bereavement was developed based on the analysis of in-depth, repeated interviews conducted with nine elderly survivors. Despite the passing of many decades the impact of Holocaust related trauma exposure was evident in the narratives of child survivors both in the form of traumatic stress symptoms and features of traumatic bereavement. The term catastrophic grief is proposed to properly capture the devastation and despair associated with the scale and complexity of Holocaust related loss in child survivors. Catastrophic grief appeared to be compounded by associated affects. The authors suggest the presence of a “Trauma Trilogy” in these child Holocaust survivors, consisting of interlinked difficulties in dealing with catastrophic grief, survivor guilt and anger, that are intimately entwined and appear central to catastrophic loss. This constellation of suffering inevitably contributed to leanings toward despair in the negotiation of Erikson’s final life conflict phase of integrity versus despair.', 'year': 2021}, {'paperId': '14cd30445560b642dea951be2b0c11b0f1ed6f14', 'title': 'Agents of memory in the post-witness era: Memory in the Living Room and changing forms of Holocaust remembrance in Israel', 'abstract': 'With the passing of the survivors of the Holocaust and the aging of the second generation, new agents and initiatives are transforming the commemorative landscape of Holocaust remembrance.

The current study explored intergenerational trauma and resilience in secondand third-generation Holocaust survivors as compared to a matched comparison group. Four groups were studied based on the participants’ Holocaust background and demographics: second generation (2GH; n=47) and third generation survivors (3GH; n=45) who self-identified as having at least one parent or grandparent, respectively, who is/was a Holocaust survivor interned during the war, and a matched comparison group (2GM; n=22, 3GM; n=13) for each generation consisting of non-Jewish descent who had one parent or grandparent who emigrated from the same European countries between 1945-1952. Ten 2GH and 3GH participants opted to complete the additional qualitative interview in which they were asked questions about their experiences as a descendant of a Holocaust survivor. Results showed that third-generation survivors endorsed more symptomatology than the matched comparison group; however, second generation survivors did not endorse more symptomatology than second generation match comparisons. Additionally, when descendants reported less adaptive family communication, affect responsiveness, and family cohesion, they reported higher levels of symptomatology. Lastly, we found that descendants who reported turning toward religion during times of stress (positive religious coping) endorsed higher levels of obsessive-compulsive and anxiety symptoms and those who endorsed turning away from religion in times of stress (negative religious coping) reported more depressive symptoms. A conceptual model is presented that includes vulnerability and resilience factors related to the intergenerational effects of Holocaust exposure. xiii ! !', 'year': 2017}, {'paperId': '15442310a810584260744f2c5e8dd0cac26bec9a', 'title': 'Oral history at the extremes of human experience: Holocaust testimony in a museum setting', 'abstract': \"This article charts the confrontation (or absence of confrontation) with Holocaust testimony since the end of the Second World War.

Long before the Yale Fortunoff Archive and the Spielberg Foundation began to videotape survivor testimony, Boder grasped the importance of getting fi rst-hand interviews from survivors. In a little over two months in Europe—from July 29 until October 4—Boder carried out 130 interviews in nine languages. As Alan Rosen points out in this magnifi cent account of a neglected pioneer of the study of testimony and trauma, Boder conducted some of the earliest, if not the earliest, audio interviews of Holocaust survivors. In addition to interviews, Boder also collected songs, and he used his wire recorder to good effect. Many survivors who were initially reluctant to speak to Boder were won over when they heard their songs played back. “The wonder of their voices” broke down some barriers and facilitated a critical meeting between a resourceful Jewish psychologist and survivors who had just emerged from the war and had not yet begun the struggle to rebuild their lives. Boder reached them at a critical time, when memories were still fresh. Boder began the project for many reasons. As a psychologist he grasped how important it was to trace the impact of the disaster on the human personality. As a Jew he instinctively understood that his ancestral home was irretrievably destroyed, and he wanted to reach out to survivors. As an American, he wanted his fellow citizens to see Displaced Persons as individuals, not as an anonymous and threatening mass. Perhaps his work, he hoped, might help break down prejudices against opening America’s doors. Unlike many Jews in the Displaced Persons camps, Boder was decidedly a universalist, not a Zionist. His own background uniquely equipped him for his pioneering mission. He was a Latvian Jew who spanned the traditional culture of East European Jewry and the world of European and American social science. His early education included the Vilna Teacher’s Seminary, a major incubator of the activist East European Jewish intelligentsia. He then moved to the famed Psychoneurological Institute in Saint Petersburg, founded by Vladimir Bekhterev. His Saint Petersburg years, 1906–1915, saw major attempts, centered in that city, to use history, folklore, and ethnography to create a modern, secular Jewish identity. It is not clear how closely Boder was acquainted with Simon Dubnow or Shlomo Rappoport (S.

As Geoffrey Hartman remarks in an interview on witnessing Holocaust video testimony (conducted by Jennifer Ballengee for this issue), “the Holocaust” is being disseminated in more media and in a wider formal arena than ever before. Now that this material has entered the public sphere, how is it to be interpreted? From film, video and photography to internet to literary criticism, philosophy, comparative history, religious studies, and beyond—and in any combination—we are confronted with an expanding array of interpretive matrices and responsibilities. One way to respond to the questions that arise when the images and associations of the Holocaust come to be disseminated throughout the culture at large—and particularly in popular culture—is to try to restore to Holocaust experience a special status. How the experience is special, and to whom it especially belongs, are questions that contributors explore. Sometimes that special experience may be said to be a mark that sets apart those who engage with it through art or scholarship or other kinds of making, even when they cannot claim to have witnessed the disaster itself. We see one version of this in the notion of the “second generation survivor,” where the children of those who were incarcerated in the camps are represented—or represent themselves—as bearing a direct relation to the event of the Holocaust, even replicating, in certain ways, their parents’ experience of that event. While many writers assert that children can absorb their parents’ experience independently of their parents’ own storytelling, the connection is more commonly theorized as emerging through representation. As Joanna Spiro puts it, “the representation of Holocaust events, necessarily ‘fictional’ for one who has no direct knowledge of them, is the one Wiesel calls perjury, Lanzmann calls transgression, and children of Holocaust victims regard as taboo.Yet it is this act of representation-to-oneself that all those in the second generation and', 'year': 2001}, {'paperId': '167309d960554a285aa866e8bc154763571613ff', 'title': 'Gathering the voices: disseminating the message of the Holocaust for the digital generation by applying an interdisciplinary approach', 'abstract': 'The aim of the Gathering the Voices project is to gather testimonies from Holocaust survivors who have made their home in Scotland and to make these testimonies available on the World Wide Web.

To date, no randomized controlled study has been carried out to examine the effectiveness of psychotherapy in HS. The present case studies report the implementation of life review therapy (LRT-HS) undertaken with two female HS with symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The mixed-methods approach sheds light to their individual therapy courses and potential mechanisms of change. Both therapies took place in the context of a randomized controlled study evaluating the efficacy of LRT-HS.

We study patterns of structure and variation in the referential aspects of narrative, how narratives recapitulate past actions, and the evaluative aspects of narrative, how narratives are interpreted.

In each set of repeated narratives, the selection narrative maintains significant portions of the complicating action and evaluations over time. At the same time, various changes are evident that alter the style or interpretation of the narrative. In other words, changes were, in large measure, observed in “how” or “why” the narrative was told but not in “what” was recounted. Our data suggests that despite changes in context, critical aspects of our identities endure over long periods of time.', 'year': 2006}, {'paperId': '1beb4db91fbe4312857b3cce719e986972090fbf', 'title': '“Fragmentary Evidence”: the Struggle to Narrate Partition', 'abstract': 'I n the gaping absence of public memorials or museums dedicated to the Partition of India, the narration of this traumatic story is vital to its commemoration.

In this way, silence is portrayed as a black hole, echoing the black hole of genocide. However, Laub, as a psychoanalyst, works with those survivors who attempt to learn how to tell the story of their trauma, for he states trauma is \"an event that has no beginning, no ending, no before, no during and no after and is therefore \\'outside the range of comprehension\\'\" (ibid 69).

We addressed the research question: What can adolescents who are using their bodies to gain empathy with Anne Frank teach us about embodied literacies? Digital images and video were used to generate a multimodal analytic method that combined focus group interviewing with the Semiotic Photo Response Protocol and Visual Discourse Analysis. Analyses of performance and visual arts texts illustrated how students layered their understandings as they recast meanings across sign systems. As students engaged their bodies in space, in motion, and in character, they learned about the socio-historical and emotional contexts in which Anne lived. These IJEA Vol. 17 No. 5 http://www.ijea.org/v17n5/ 2 findings suggest that arts-integrated and embodied learning opportunities may support students’ sensemaking about complex narratives. The Anne Frank narrative has long occupied a prominent place in English language arts (ELA) and social studies curriculums in the United States. Anne’s life and writing deserve even greater attention today as the number of living Holocaust survivors dwindles and the last living testimonies cease to exist. Although a number of meaningful projects have sought to ensure that the voices of Holocaust survivors live on in perpetuity, the Anne Frank narrative is for many middle grades students the first and only exposure they have to the Holocaust (Magilow & Silverman, 2015). It is likely also the only personal Jewish narrative they encounter officially in the ELA curriculum. Therefore, the ways in which classroom instruction frames this powerful topic shapes how students connect personally with Anne’s narrative and the questions and meanings they construct about the Holocaust. We examined the use of an arts-based instructional framework to engage middle school learners in developing empathetic perspectives on the Anne Frank narrative. Taking on another’s perspective to empathize is a 21st-century skill that can develop through relational literacy practices (Chisholm & Keller, 2014). Middle school students today encounter the harsh realities of life in their local and global communities. For example, students in this project used the arts to grapple with socio-political issues like rape culture, body image, and domestic violence. Students raised critical questions about the nature of such ethically and emotionally difficult topics in affective and cognitive ways. We conceptualized empathy as a relational literacy practice that places one’s body and mind in the context of another, thereby affording the learner multiple perspectives on texts and the capacity to draw on those perspectives to act in the world. We asked the research question: What can adolescents who are using their bodies to gain empathy with Anne Frank teach us about embodied literacies? In this article, we examine two examples of multimodal literacy learning that were part of an embodied approach to ELA and social studies instruction. Our parallel multimodal analysis made visible the ways in which students used their bodies in space, in motion, and in character to learn about Anne Frank. This work contributes to the pedagogical and methodological literature about arts-based literacy instruction by examining the multimodal processes and texts students used and constructed as part of learning about the Holocaust. 1 For example, the University of Southern California Shoah Foundation’s Institute for Visual History and Education, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum’s First Person podcast series and Echoes of Memory writing workshops for survivors of the Holocaust. Chisholm & Whitmore: Bodies in Space/Bodies in Motion/Bodies in Character 3 Sociocultural and Multimodal Perspectives on Literacy and Learning This study is grounded in the sociocultural notion that all learning is mediated, or brought about through cultural tools of various sorts (Kozulin, 2003; Wertsch, 2007) and that issues of identity, agency, and power shape in consequential ways how and to what ends learners engage in literacy tasks (Lewis, Enciso, & Moje, 2007). Vygotsky (1982) identifies the concept of mediation as “the central fact about our psychology” (p. 166). From a sociocultural perspective, mediation—the process by which meaning is realized primarily although not exclusively through language—is consequential to learning (Kozulin, 1998). In other words, signs mediate thinking “externally” and meanings mediate thinking “internally” (Moll, 2014, p. 34). Mediational means in instructional settings include not only tangible human and symbolic tools such as teachers, students, and texts, but also less obvious, and often overlooked tools such as images, bodies, and spatial relationships. In fact, Moll (2014) synthesizes Vygotskian theorists’ work on mediation to categorize the concept according to five classes of mediators, two of which we pay particular attention to in this study: “[s]emiotic mediation: the use of symbol systems, such as language, writing, art, and mathematics [and] [a]natomical mediation: the use of the body, such as the hands and arms, which permit manipulation of the environment and representation of self in social life” (p. 31). We recognize the power of mediation for making distant historical, literary, and cultural content more concrete for youth. We consider the ways in which learners use art and language (semiotic mediation) and their bodies in space, in motion, and in character (anatomical mediation) to learn about Anne Frank. For this study, we foreground the mediating affordances of diverse sign systems. Gestural, musical, sculptural, visual, and other modes are ways students make and transform meaning with others in addition to verbal communication. Multimodality, which is the combination of different modes, increases learners’ access points to the curriculum (Albers, 2006), generates insights into texts and students’ own lives (Berghoff, Egawa, Harste, & Hoonan, 2000; Pahl & Rowsell, 2005) and offers additional means for students to demonstrate understanding. In particular, we leverage for analytical purposes the semiotic concept of transmediation (Siegel, 1995; Suhor, 1984). Transmediation occurs when students interpret texts that originate in one sign system and recast that meaning into another sign system. In our study transmediation refers to variations on “the process of taking what one knows in language and representing it in art” (Harste, 2014, p. 88), and, vice versa, by putting words and verbal expression to visual images. As Albers (2006) argues, “meaning is not located within any one mode, but in how the modes are interpreted in relation to each other” (p. 77). Transmediating understandings across IJEA Vol. 17 No. 5 http://www.ijea.org/v17n5/ 4 semiotic systems is shown to expand students’ perspectives (Cowan & Albers, 2006) and extend the interpretive potential of texts (Zoss, 2009). “Simultaneously tapping the nonredundant potentials of talk and visual representation extends the generative and reflective power of transmediation” (Whitin, 2005, p. 392). The importance of this concept cannot be underestimated. In fact, literacy, according to some scholars, is reflected in a learner’s ease with which he or she can transmediate (Cowan & Albers, 2006; Harste, 2000). The ability to mediate the actual world and the perceived world through multiple sign systems promotes the power of students’ voices, and quite possibly the critical consciousness of our society, resulting in potentially more democratic interactions within and among cultures (Harste, 2000, 2014). Review of Literature We situate this study in two areas of the research literature—research on teaching and learning literature about the Holocaust and research on embodied literacies. Our study fits in the intersection of these areas to particularly attend to what students taught us about embodied literacies as they drew empathetic connections between their contemporary lives and the life of Anne Frank and grappled with incomprehensible content that can only be “worked through” and never “comprehended” (LaCapra, 1996; Simon et al., 2014). Research on Teaching and Learning Literature about the Holocaust Research on Holocaust education in K-12 ELA and social studies classrooms continues to emphasize the complexities and controversies surrounding the design, implementation, and evaluation—indeed the larger purpose—of instruction about this topic. Among the complexities and controversies that have arisen within educational studies of the Holocaust, scholars consider the unintended consequences of teachers’ unexamined assumptions about the moralistic, didactic, and authoritative messages embedded in the study of texts with “disturbing pasts” (Juzwik, 2013; Schweber, 2004). Text selections that sensationalize and trivialize individuals’ experiences during the Holocaust (Spector & Jones, 2007) and problematic ways of framing the historical facts of the Holocaust have led to student misconceptions and a tendency to produce gross generalizations that distance the persons and events of the Holocaust from contemporary life (Gray, 2010; Schmidt, 2009). In reflecting on her experiences teaching a unit on Anne Frank as an early career English teacher, Juzwik (2013) identifies the tension that emerged as she sought to maintain her transactional literacy goals for her students while also attempting to “engage the detailed particularity of the Holocaust” (p. 291). Anne Frank’s writing connects with many readers and such connections are often held up as “best practice” in ELA classrooms. However, an ethical treatment of Anne’s diary, Juzwik argues, contextualizes Anne’s writing using historical facts Chisholm & Whitmore: Bodies in Space/Bodies in Mot', 'year': 2016}, {'paperId': '1ce5b7903a479efea492e8ba4bdcd6141c7091bb', 'title': 'Relevance criteria used by teachers in selecting oral history materials', 'abstract': 'From a user-centered and task-specific perspective on relevance, we studied the relevance criteria used by teachers - an understudied but important group - who were searching for materials to use in the classroom to support learning on a particular theme.

While most readers may already have some knowledge about the role of gender in the Holocaust (e.g., the oft-depicted separation of men from women during selections in the concentration camps), this book tells us much more. Tec uses a wide array of data (including individual testimonies and memoirs as well as her own interviews with survivors) to assess the differences in men’s and women’s experiences in a variety of settings, including concentration camps as well as ghettos and resistance organizations. The stories and quotes she presents are painful to read, but they are also quite rich and clearly illustrative of gender differences. For instance, because European Jewish men and women occupied different positions in prewar society (with men acting as economic providers and women assuming responsibility for the care of the family and home), they brought different sets of resources with them to each situation (e.g., ghetto or camp). In the ghettos, where many men were precluded from working in their pre-war occupations, their inability to provide for their families often caused depression; many respondents recalled their fathers and other adult males withdrawing and “giving up.” In contrast, women’s traditional work of feeding the family was especially valued in the ghettos, where food and water shortages put women’s domestic skills to the test. Tec therefore suggests that women experienced less of a disjuncture between their pre-war and wartime roles than men did. In one particularly sad set of quotes, some respondents admitted that they did not remember ever having seen their mothers eat while in the ghetto. These examples suggest that even under the dire circumstances of the ghettos, women were better able to live up to their expected roles, whereas men had more difficulties doing so. By choosing the subtitle “Women, Men, and the Holocaust,” however, the author might be a little too humble in her own summary of her findings. That is, this book is not just about gender differences in the Holocaust experience. Instead, it is an “intersectional” analysis that takes seriously the interactions between gender and a number of other statuses such as class, age, parental status, religiosity, nationality, and culture. For example, while women in general seemed to fare better than men in the camps, it was childless women who were better able to survive, as women who arrived in camps with their children were killed immediately. Class also intersected with gender in interesting ways. Upper class Jewish men had more difficulties adapting to life in the ghettos and camps than did working class Jewish men; upper class men were less likely to have the job skills (e.g., the ability to operate factory machinery) that led to survival, and were more susceptible to the depression and anguish that went along with the loss of ability to provide for the family. For women, however, class distinctions were less meaningful: Tec argues that women’s pre-war class standing reflected their husbands’ position more than their own, which meant that class was less relevant to self-esteem and emotional health. As a woman and a Holocaust survivor herself, it is somewhat surprising that the author has waited until her fifth published book on the Holocaust to pursue an explicitly gendered analysis. As she notes in the book’s Introduction, however, some of her respondents were hesitant to focus on gender differences for fear that doing so would diminish the role of Jewishness in the Holocaust. While respectful of this view, Tec gently pushed her respondents to consider gender as a useful analytic category by presenting other data to them that illustrated gender differences. In my opinion, this is no small point. These respondents’ reluctance to discuss gender, even with a fellow survivor, may well be the reason why we have seen few analyses like this one, and it makes this book all the more important.

The academic canon on post-1994 Rwanda focuses the mostly on politics around this official memory that has evolved into hegemonic memory and on how it has been mobilized to promote a selective memory of the past. However, there is little analysis of vernacular, bottom-up memory practices that have evolved alongside the official one. Using observation, semi-structured interviews, and secondary sources, this article examines vernacular memory practices of mourning the wartime missing in Rwanda. Through the concepts of ‘multidirectional’ and ‘traveling’ memory, this study examines how survivors of these interconnected violent histories that unfolded in two different countries claim multi-faceted Agaciro (dignity, self-respect, and self-worth) through two different memory approaches. The article argues that while actors in official memory approach claim Agaciro through borrowing from another global hegemonic memory, respondents in this study created vernacular avenues to remember their missing loved ones. The article finds that while hegemonic memory might appear to only compete with vernacular memory, there are also ‘knots’ that connect these two memory forms in Rwanda’s context and beyond. In its conclusion, the article proposes an Agaciro- centred approach to examine the relationships between official and unofficial memory practices that have been reener-gized through protests both offline and online in Rwanda and beyond.

French with English subtitles. Nanjing: Memory and Oblivion As its title suggests, this film is less about the Japanese massacre of civilians in Nanking (aka Nanjing) in 1937 than about the struggle between those who insist it be remembered and those who want it erased from history. Unsurprisingly, though, the film spends a significant amount of its running time presenting the facts under dispute. Otherwise, how would we know what the fuss is all about? Thus the film, as in almost any conceivable film of this sort, takes the side of those who wish the massacre to be remembered. (One wonders how a denialist would make a documentary in support of his position. How could he show what is under dispute except by showing it, and thus establishing it? Documentaries are suitable for evidencing a positive, not a negative.) The film presents the widely accepted version of what happened: in 1937, the Japanese army marched into Nanking and, over a period of weeks, slaughtered somewhere between two hundred thousand and three hundred thousand men, women, and children not just indiscriminately but sadistically. Director Prazan assembles his account of the atrocities through interviews with survivors and Japanese veterans, photographs and amateur film footage, newsreel footage, and contemporary newspaper accounts. In the midst of the savagery recounted in this part of the film, two particularly unsettling stories emerge. One of them, sadly ironic, is about one John Rabe, a member of the Nazi Party and head of Siemens\\' Nanking branch. He volunteered to head a \"safety zone\" which, although frequently violated, harbored thousands of defenseless Chinese. He alerted Berlin to what was happening, but according to the film\\'s narrator, Hitler was indifferent to the fate of the Nanking Chinese. After the war, in Germany, Rabe was prosecuted for having been a member of the Nazi Party. The other story is that of two Japanese commanding officers who made what they considered an amusing, gentlemanly bet about which of them would be the first personally to kill a hundred Chinese. When one of the officers clocked in with a hundred and six victims and the other just one less, their competition was deemed to close to call, and so the goal was raised to a hundred and fifty. That this gruesome contest was reported on with enthusiasm in Japanese newspapers serves as evidence that it most probably happened. But the broader battle over the extent or even the reality of the Nanking massacre strikingly resembles, in structure, the battle over the historical truth of the Holocaust, and is at some points tied to it. …', 'year': 2009}, {'paperId': '20b0f9089f7356bade5797edc830f52f0a00cfc0', 'title': 'The Graphic Memoir: Art Spiegelman’s Maus: A Survivor’s Tale', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2007}, {'paperId': '20ce087d97762ad6d26ed5371eb838c863f05f4f', 'title': 'Trauma and Forgiveness: Is the Holocaust traumatic?', 'abstract': 'One of the most influential contemporary accounts of psychological trauma, that of Cathy Caruth, does not fit some of the most traumatized men and women of the twentieth century: survivors of the Holocaust.

Impacted by the pedagogic experience of state-engineered high school trips to sites of Holocaust atrocity and the promotion of GCOS testimony, ethnographic interviews disclose GCOS critique of parental silence. GCOS aim to usurp their parents’ role as ‘authentic’ carriers of memory by salvaging the silenced past and performing state-enlisted public testimony. The GCOS trajectory from familial silence to publically enlisted and performed voice is for some however contingent upon GCOS ‘authentic’ embodied memories of silent Holocaust-related relations with their parents – children of survivors (COS) or with grandparent-survivors. Other GGOS warn of the ‘flattening effect’ of public voice on the authenticity and emotional complexity of familial silent memories. Moving beyond unidirectional relations between voice and silence, where voice emancipates silenced pasts or silence absences voice, GCOS accounts reflexively depict the complex bidirectional and mutually qualifying trajectories between testimonial voice and familial silence.

Forms of testimony include structured and unstructured interviews; audio, video, and written narratives; individual and group formats; and recollections of survivors young and old—from those who testified just after the war to those who only came forth decades later. Different combinations of these distinct forms of testimony contribute to their variety. Most of the time such testimony has aimed to fill out the historical record or deepen moral reflection. Early on, they offered insight into what occurred during the Holocaust, sometimes providing vivid details that revealed the horrific experiences the survivors had endured. This early approach gave those who had not been on the scene an inside look into what actually happened during the Holocaust. Much of the testimony was by those who had experienced the Holocaust themselves. Later, the focus turned to residual trauma and how it manifested itself in the daily life of survivors. Others viewed testimony as potentially therapeutic and elicited it through engaging with survivors in sustained conversations or by encouraging them to give voice to wartime childhood memories. Ultimately, as a more positive and intergenerational perspective began to take hold in the field of psychology, trauma has been seen as something that can be transcended. Hence, some scholars have highlighted the psychological insight to be found within oral and written testimony.

For many older survivors of historical traumas such as the Holocaust, natural disasters, and childhood abuses, to name but a few, this will come as no surprise as they deal with chronic symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, and/or suicidal ideation. In addition, there are also impacts on physical and cognitive health, but these will not be considered here. Psychological outcomes are quite varied. Over the past decade, there has been research exploring moderating and mediating factors of late-life mental health outcomes of trauma, for example, the impact of the timing of the trauma in the life course (Ogle et al., 2013), the type of trauma (Beristianos et al., 2016), and the interaction of sex differences and types of trauma experiences from wartime (Korinek et al., 2017).

Self-report data on lifetime traumatic life events, suicidal ideation, daily hassles, health concerns, symptoms of post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression, social support, pain, and demographic data were linked with Quebec’s administrative data on health care, medications, and physician diagnoses which were used for anxiodepressive disorders. Using path analysis, in which the relationships between variables are assumed to be linear and additive (whichmight not necessarily be the case), Vasiliadis et al. examined the relationships between lifetime traumas, post-traumatic stress and anxio-depressive disorders, and suicidal ideation in the previous 6months for males and females separately. They found that the effects of lifetime trauma persist into old age and that the association between different traumas and suicidal ideation is partially mediated by post-traumatic stress syndrome and/or anxiodepressive disorder with sex-specific pathways. In males, traumas of sexual assault, violence/stalked, war/combat/imprisonment, and daily hassles were directly associated with suicidal ideation, while in females, only daily hassles were directly associated with suicidal ideation. For females, post-traumatic stressmediated the relationship between some lifetime traumas and suicidal ideation, while in males, a number of traumas were associated with suicidal ideation through the mediating effect of post-traumatic stress and anxio-depressive disorder. While these findings need to be replicated, the findings of different sex-specific pathways linking trauma with suicidal ideation are important as it is suggestive that different approaches might be needed for males and females in suicide prevention, an observation that is consistent with sex differences found in the outcomes of late-life suicide prevention programs (Lapierre et al., 2011). Sex differences have also been reported in the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions where women as compared to men were more likely to report moderate or high occurrence stressful life events and that the associations between stressful life events and multiple psychiatric disorders were stronger in women compared to men (Armstrong et al., 2018). A study of older North Vietnamese survivors of the Vietnam War found that while PTSD symptoms were greater in those with involvement in killing or causing severe injury and who observed war atrocities, in women, PTSD was positively correlatedwith war era child death and spousal separation (Korinek et al., 2017).

The contributions address the following questions: How do historians, artists, scholars, and teachers negotiate the language of the Holocaust as survivors die, leaving future generations to respond to the dictum: Never again? How do children and grandchildren of survivors, perpetrators, bystanders transmit the difficult legacy of the Holocaust in American, Israeli, French, German, Swiss and Austrian contexts while navigating feelings of transgenerational guilt or victimhood? How can we do justice to survivor testimony when the survivors can no longer speak directly or mediate the testimony to us? How does transferred and multiply mediated knowledge translate into meaningful artifacts for the next generations?

It is now in its second decade. An early feature and highlight of the course was an interview with a professional. The interview was conscience sensitive in nature and the professional, invited to help course participants understand how personal conscience figured in professionalism and ethics was, accordingly, known as \\'the professional of conscience\\'. Among those who agreed to be interviewed were social workers, psychiatric and other physicians, a businessman who was a survivor of the Holocaust, and a minister who had become an activist on behalf of gay rights and persons living with HIV. Each guest was remarkable in his or her willingness to participate in self-disclosure for the sake of illuminating the transformation of conscience from personal to professional. For those privileged to be present to hear them—or better put: to bear them witness— the interviews were moving, moral, human encounters. A few of the guests are now deceased. None of their interviews were recorded except in memory. In time, CCPE changed. Room was needed for other courses in an expanding curriculum and, when the time allotted CCPE was reduced, the interview of \\'a professional of conscience\\' was one of the features lost. However, balancing this loss of role modeling, a more interactive group experience was gained in which participants became engaged in responding to inquiries about themselves undergoing their own transformation as persons to professionals of conscience. Nonetheless, the preceptors of the course, now among the editorial staff of Conscience Works) remember how richly rewarding it was to have seasoned professionals in conversation about conscience. Efforts have been made by the editorial staff of Conscience Works to preserve responses to semi-structured interviews of diverse persons telling how they became professionals of conscience. Two years ago, an article entitled \" Trying on the Rings of Glaucon: Conscience Centered Medical Ethics \" appeared in the Conscience and Ethics department of Conscience Works Vol. II, no.2, 1-23. The position taken by the authors was that a secular examination of the professional\\'s conscience could be conducted with the help of conscience sensitive clinical educators and that such an examination would have at least instrumental and contributory value, and perhaps intrinsic and original value as well, with respect to a practical, coherent, as well as more fully self-aware approach to bio-ethical concerns.

Hitlers Menschenhandler. Das Schicksal der Mustauschjuden». Berlin: Rotbuch Verlag, 2013. 334 pp. euro24.99 (hardcover).It does not happen every day that a reviewer turns out to be one of the main actors of the book he has been asked to review. This is one of those rare cases. In Hitlers Menschenhandler, I appear frequently as a Holocaust survivor who was rescued from the concentration camp of Bergen-Belsen after spending five months there at the age of eleven.Let me start with a small correction and a criticism. The correction: I am not, as the authors claim, from Slovakia, but from Cluj in Transylvania, which belonged to Romania when I was born, was handed to Hungary for services rendered by Hitler in 1940, and returned to Romania, for the same reason, by Stalin in 1945.The criticism: the authors thank the protagonists of the book, a number of Holocaust survivors, for allowing themselves to be interviewed, but they do not mention that these interviews first entered the public domain in a documentary shown on German television. The documentary acknowledged three creators: Ammann, Aust, and Caroline Schmidt, who was responsible for recording the interview with me. In the book, Ammann and Aust rely mainly on the German version ofmy book, Dealingwith Satan. RezsBKasztnersDaringRescue Mission (London: Jonathan Cape 2008): Geschafte mit dem Teufel. Die Tragodie des Judenretters Rezso Kasztner (Cologne: Bohlau Verlag, 2010). But despite to some extent also quoting me from Caroline Schmidt\\'s interview for the original documentary, they mention neither that interview nor Caroline Schmidt.It is not widely known that during World War II some Jews were spared the \"Final Solution\" in order to be exchanged for German nationals held in enemy countries. With that aim, they were kept alive in Bergen-Belsen, which was not an extermination camp but which became notorious for the lethal consequences of overcrowding and callous neglect. When \"Belsen\" in the last months of the war became a hell in which thousands died of starvation and typhus, most of the \"exchange Jews\" were still waiting to be exchanged.Basically, the book breaks down into two parts. The first deals with Jews from the Netherlands, including refugees from Germany. The second, somewhat longer and more dramatic, deals with Jews from Hungary, including refugees from East European countries. The obvious link between the two discrete parts is the location Bergen-Belsen and the theme of attempted rescue.Hitler\\'s army invaded the Netherlands on 10 May 1940. Anti-Jewish measures began immediately. The Jews were gradually deprived of all their rights and possessions and confined in holding camps before being shipped off to the death camps. The most notorious was Westerbork. From here, between 1942 and 1944, some 97,000 Jews were deported to Auschwitz, Sobibor, and Theresienstadt. About 3,700 others were taken to Bergen-Belsen. They were held in the \"Sternlager,\" where they had to wear the yellow star, do hard labor, and suffered ill-treatment. Their backgrounds varied, but they had managed to acquire documents -some genuine, some fictitious-that promised to admit them to Allied or neutral countries. However, in the event, very few escaped that way. Many of them died in Bergen-Belsen; others were liberated by Allied troops either from Bergen-Belsen itself or while being transported to other camps. …', 'year': 2014}, {'paperId': '250a56d6f98ceb7c6e8b608b4a3ae308ebf13b52', 'title': 'Health Care Provider Considerations in Providing Care to Aging Patients with Early Life Trauma', 'abstract': 'Health care providers work with an increasing aging population, one with numerous trauma survivors.

The report used the term cyberscholarship to describe new forms of research that become possible when high-performance computing meets digital libraries. [1] Elsewhere in this issue of the Journal of Electronic Publishing, Ronald Larsen describes the workshop and its conclusions. In this article, William Arms gives a personal view of the motivation behind the workshop and the roles of libraries and publishing in achieving its goals. In a recent seminar, Gregory Crane of Tufts University made the simple but profound statement, \"When collections get large, only the computer reads every word\". [2] Thomas Jefferson\\'s library, which formed the nucleus of the Library of Congress, had 6,487 volumes—a large private collection in its day. [3] Edward Gibbon\\'s famous library catalog had 2,675 records (which he wrote on the back of playing cards). [4] Avid readers, like Jefferson and Gibbon, can read and digest thousands of books, but modern research libraries are so large that nobody can read everything in them. The marriage of high-performance computing with digital libraries introduces a completely new notion of scale. High-performance computing can bring together vast quantities of material—datasets, manuscripts, reports, etc.—that might never make their way into a traditional library. A scholar reads only a few hundreds of documents; a supercomputer can analyze millions. Of course, a person has a rich understanding of what is being read while a computer works at a very superficial level, but profound research is possible by simple analysis of huge amounts of information. Computer programs can identify latent patterns of information or relationships that will never be found by human searching and browsing. This new form of research can be called cyberscholarship. Cyberscholarship becomes possible only when there are digital libraries with extensive collections in a broad domain. Such collections are large even by supercomputing standards. For instance, the USC Shoah Foundation\\'s video collection of 52,000 interviews with survivors of genocide, notably the Nazi holocaust, is about 400 terabytes. [5] The Library of Congress\\'s National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program (NDIIPP) supports collaborative projects to preserve digital content. [6] There is no published estimate for the aggregate size of these projects, but a rough estimate is at least one petabyte or 1,000 terabytes. Many research libraries have begun to digitize the books in their collections, working with organizations such as the Open Content Alliance, Google, or Microsoft. These collections are becoming very large. Digitized copies of the eight million books in the Cornell library alone will generate an estimated four petabytes of data. A plausible view of today\\'s developments sees these digital collections as the future of research libraries. Already, many scientists never enter a library building or read the printed copy of a journal. Their reports, working papers, conference proceedings, datasets, images, audio, videos, software, and journal articles are created in digital formats and accessed via networks, and a large proportion of older content has been EPUB', 'year': 2008}, {'paperId': '25fcf3ca0da270dc45b8d1c42377ab1b23546570', 'title': 'They Called Me Mayer July: Painted Memories of a Jewish Childhood in Poland Before the Holocaust (review)', 'abstract': 'Mayer Kirshenblatt and Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, They Called Me Mayer July: Painted Memories of a Jewish Childhood in Poland Before the Holocaust. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007. 411 pp. In the 1930s, Poland was home to the largest Jewish community in Europe, forming 10% of that nation\\'s total population, with an almost 1000-year history reaching back to the beginnings of Poland itself. A substantial number of Jews inhabited bigger urban areas, primarily working in trade, manufacturing, and craft cottage industries. Most, however, resided in smaller towns and villages where over the centuries they created a unique kind of community, the shtetl (Yiddish diminutive for shtot, or town), living alongside the largely Catholic population, many of them peasants. \"Morally and spiritually, the two societies remained resolutely separate, by choice on both sides. Yet they lived in close physical proximity and...familiarity. In the shtetl, pluralism was experienced not as ideology, but as ordinary life\" (Hoffman 1997:12). Reading They Called Me Mayer July, one gets a sense of what such a life was like in interwar Poyln, as Poland was known to Yiddish-speaking Jews. Through his recollections and stories, illustrated with over 200 paintings and drawings, full of remarkable details of daily communal life, Mayer Kirshenblatt offers us a unique window onto a world that no longer exists. And it is this latter fact that also makes this book an important contribution to our understanding of the Holocaust and the degree to which it succeeded in erasing a life-way, a culture, a history, a community. At the very start of the book, Kirshenblatt explains how he was drawn to this project, when he taught himself to paint at the age of 73. He would get together \" in the steam room at the gym or in a corner of the health club\" with his buddies, most of whom were Holocaust survivors. Within five or ten minutes of any conversation, whether the topic was politics, women, this or that, we would be back in the concentration camps, on the march, in the railroad cars, in the bush with the partisans. It was as if there were no life before the war, so overshadowed had their memories become by the pain they suffered. I lost many members of my family in the Holocaust, but God spared me from living through that horror myself. He also blessed me with a wonderful memory (p. 2). With the help and encouragement of his daughter, Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, anthropologist, folklorist, and co-author of this volume, he set out to recapture that prewar life, creating a visual and textual memoir of his childhood growing up in the rabbinic town of Apt (its Yiddish name, Opatow in Polish), which in 1931 had 5,436 Jews out of a population of 9,512. For many postwar Jews, the shtetl has become the site of Jewish authenticity and a metaphor for loss, according to Eva Hoffman. For some it conjures up \"poignant, warm images of people in quaint black garb, or Chagall-like crooked streets...For others, it means pogroms and peasant barbarism. Yet while it existed, the shtetl was neither a utopia nor a dystopia, but a coherent, curious, and surprisingly resilient social formation... closely interwoven, reassuringly familiar\" (Hoffman 1998:11-12). Kirshenblatt manages to capture this latter image without diminishing either the nostalgic or tragic elements the characterized his own life, as well as that of his family and his neighbors. Previous books have documented the diversity and vitality of pre-Holocaust Jewish life in Poland and other East European regions, based on photographs, historical documents, family letters and diaries, and testimonies of those who survived the war (e.g., Eliach 1998, Kacyzne 1999, Vishniac 1983). In fact, one of these, a photographic history titled Image Before My Eyes, is coauthored by Mayer\\'s daughter, Barbara Kirshenblatt- Gimblett with Lucjan Dobroszycki (1977). What makes Kirshenblatt\\'s project unique is the combination of illustration and wide-ranging narrative-created out of forty years of interviews done by the daughter \" listening with love\" to the father (p. …', 'year': 2008}, {'paperId': '2653f757d3c39b19eef01a4a3c328398332c7ea3', 'title': 'Caring for Life: Nursing During the Holocaust', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2002}, {'paperId': '269b91e2ac68cb5f86ae01a0c3f3c06a2a98b3fe', 'title': 'Geographies of the Holocaust: Experiments in GIS, QSR, and Graph Representations', 'abstract': \"This article responds to the widespread and oft-noted challenges digital humanists face in working with data that is uncertain and characterised by complex narratives. Using an example drawn from the vast archives of post-war interviews with Holocaust survivors, it draws on approaches developed in Qualitative Spatial Representation (QSR) to explore how two key spatial aspects of survivor's narratives – their uncertain wartime trajectories and the slippage in scales as these are retold – can be represented. Spatial information in narratives tends to not provide the exact coordinates necessary to store the information in geospatial databases. Instead, narratives rely much more on often less precise qualitative spatial relations such as ‘near’, ‘next to’, ‘at the corner of’ without precise geometric interpretations. Given that relational databases are ill-equipped to store this kind of relational spatial knowledge from natural language sources, the article argues for a need for digital humanists to return to first principles and reconsider database design. Descriptive triple-based graph representations, which have been devised to accommodate this kind of highly irregular, semi-structured relational knowledge, have the potential to work with, rather than against, the grain of the narrative sources that underlie the work of much of the digital humanities.\", 'year': 2019}, {'paperId': '26e91bdf85cafd2b7db749ce00f8802e3f7caaa1', 'title': 'Vera Gissing interview', 'abstract': 'Interview with Vera Gissing, child survivor of the Nazi Holocaust of the Jews, by Sid Bolkosky.', 'year': 2006}, {'paperId': '2725b2c52fc1791a83346dc8963a159bcb0607c7', 'title': 'Sounds of Defiance: The Holocaust, Multilingualism and the Problem of English (review)', 'abstract': 'Sounds of Defiance: The Holocaust, Multilingualism and the Problem of English, by Alan Rosen. Lincoln and London: University of Nebraska Press, 2005. 241 pp. $45.00. Alan Rosen, who has read widely in recent scholarship on the Holocaust, engages the ideas of such thinkers as Dorothy Bilik, Shoshana Felman, Sander Gilman, Alan Mintz, and Hana Wirth-Nesher. Like many of these critics, he approaches the subject of Holocaust history, fiction, and film with an appreciation of spoken and written Polish, Yiddish, Hebrew, and German as well as English languages and traditions. Indeed, what he contributes to our understanding of North American litet ary history in the post-World War II period is a keen awareness of how English itself is challenged and changed, devalued and revalued, marginalized and then oddly centralized by the sounds and senses of idioms more deeply implicated in the everyday disasters that beleaguered European Jewry during the \"final solution.\" Because English was not spoken by most petpetrators and victims, North American creators of testimonials and novels, movies and historical investiga- tions often emphasized the problematical language in which they were composing. Foreign accents and words, narratives about lost and found, learned or regained mother and other tongues abound in Rosen\\'s texts, whose audiors for the most part tecognized the marginality and neutrality of English in relation to the Holocaust experience. The chronological and generic range of Rosen\\'s texts is broad: he includes the psychologist David Boder, whose transcribed interviews of displaced persons were printed in English right after the war, John Hersey\\'s novel The Wall (1950), Ruth Chattertons novel Homeward Borne (1950), Philip Roth\\'s short story \"Eli, The Fanatic\" (1959), Edward Wallant\\'s novel The Pawnbroker (1961), Hannah Arendts articles on Eichmann in Jerusalem (1963), Sidney Lumet\\'s film adaptation of The Pawnbroker (1965), Cynthia Ozick\\'s two-stoty collection The Shawl (1989), Yaffa Eliach\\'s revision of survivors\\' stories Hasidic Tales of the Holocaust (1988), Art Spiegelman\\'s Maus (1986-91), and Anne Michaels\\'s lyrical novel Fugitive Pieces (1996). Each close reading enables Rosen to elaborate upon the different meanings of the English language\\'s marginality and neutrality in relation to the Shoah. Despite a miserably unreliable Index, teachers will find useful insights into wotks often assigned in Holocaust studies courses. Rosen\\'s discussion of Cynthia Ozick\\'s allusions to Celan and Shakespeare, for instance, enriches understanding of maternal loss in The Shawl. Similarly, Rosen explains how Art Spiegelman\\'s survivor-father gains a measure of control and the means to endure persecution through his acquisition of English and yet how his fractured narrative voice manages \"to torture English into being a foreign language\" (p. …', 'year': 2007}, {'paperId': '28955e0f1e33232b1ab82571a7a87395c1369676', 'title': 'Interviewing Holocaust survivors: Perceptions on three levels', 'abstract': 'For a number of years, I have been researching Jewish immigration to Melbourne from the Polish town of Bia1ystok. Initially my reasons for choosing this city concentrated around my own background, my family having emigrated from Bialystok to Melbourne both before and after World War II. When I commenced this research, I expected - somewhat naively - to work through the traditional stages of immigration history, namely, some description of the respondents I home, their journey to Australia, their reception upon arrival and some of the difficulties encountered in the immigration process. I was unprepared for the layers of experience and psychological interpretations that were, 1n fact, .8 necessary part of interviewing this group of people. What I discovered was that the Holocaust was not simply one set of experiences encountered by my respondents: in fact, it formed an integral and very complicated part of their interpretations of their past, their present and even their attitudes about the future [in the form of second-generation] in many instances. In other words, instead of working through the usual two-phase experience associated with the migration process, there were at least three levels to contend with in the case of Jewish immigrants from Bialystok to Melbourne. These were pre-World War II, the Holocaust, and emigrating to Melbourne after the war. For those respondents who had arrived in Melbourne before the war a parallel although somewhat different structure existed. For although they had not personally experienced the traumas of the Holocaust, most of them had lost their entire families to it and therefore there was a strong residue of emotions, perceptions and experiences which needed to be accounted for, which still formed part of the immigration process. For example, an idealization of the past world of Bialystok, which they had left behind forever when immigrating to Australia, and an almost overwhelming sense of guilt in many cases (that these immigrants had survived the horrors of the Second World War whilst their loved ones had fallen victim to it), were the driving forces leading to the establishment and much of the work of the Bialystok Centre here in Melbourne, an institution which was instrumental in the immigration to Melbourne of hundreds of Bialystok refugees.

Shenker’s well-researched monograph is the latest work on a topic that deserves reexamination: the creation and use of Holocaust video testimony in the so-called “era of the witness.” The global effort to film Holocaust testimony that began (roughly) in the late 1970s and peaked in the 1990s constituted a historical event in its own right, as Annette Wieviorka has argued. During this time, scholars such as Geoffrey Hartman, Lawrence Langer, Shoshana Felman, Dori Laub, and Henry Greenspan dedicated substantial books and book chapters to the subject. These witness-critics were oriented toward the present-day, the poetic, and the internal life of the people caught on camera. For various reasons, this psycho-poetic mode of witnesscriticism became much less prominent at the start of the new millenium. Since Christopher Browning published his methodological essay Collected Memories, scholars have tended to draw discrete pieces of empirical information from these testimonies, while leaving aside analytic discussions about the recordings themselves. Strikingly, of late prominent scholars have mentioned these recordings almost dismissively, as foils to other testimony or documentary collections whose value they wish to highlight. In Reframing Holocaust Testimony, Shenker shifts the discussion around video testimony, signaling that scholars have yet to address more dimensions to these memory-making enterprises. Shenker’s most important contributions relate to two new “frames” of analysis: the cinematic decisions involved in creating these sources, what he calls “off-camera dimensions of testimony”; and the differing institutional cultures that produced, then disseminated this video material (pp. 14, 15). The book devotes chapters to three of the leading institutions responsible for recording and archiving tens of thousands of testimonies: the Fortunoff Archive for Holocaust Testimonies at Yale University, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, and the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation. While scholars often encounter rumors and apocrypha about the inner workings of these testimony-recording organizations, Shenker sets the record straight by digging through their internal archives and by interviewing personnel. Shenker was interested in “the methods interviewers use to engage witnesses in discussions on how [the latter] became aware of events they describe...; the kinds of narrative outlines the archive uses to attempt to structure testimonies, often into coherent, sequential units; and the degree to which subjects are given adequate space in which to assert their own agency in delivering their stories” (p. 13). Shenker is at his best when revealing behind-the-scenes methods of sorting and curating video testimonies, practices viewers and scholars could not otherwise know. We learn, for example, that both the USHMM Oral History Branch and the Shoah Foundation developed internal rating systems for testimonies (pp. 79, 135). The USHMM designed its system to select clips suitable for museum spaces: each', 'year': 2017}, {'paperId': '2cdcc05cc9216c02af25eaf9b7c615c8d9d0cfc1', 'title': 'Shards of Memory: Narratives of Holocaust Survival', 'abstract': 'Shards of Memory: Narratives of Holocaust Survival, edited by Yehudi Lindeman. Westport, CT: Praeger Publishers, 2007. 256 pp. $49.95. The photograph of Rena S. appears to be that of an ordinary teenage girl from the early 1940s. But as we read on, we learn her harrowing story of survival from the Krakow ghetto to the camp known as Plaszow and finally beating the odds of imprisonment at Auschwitz and then Bergen-Belsen. Liberated by the Americans in 1945, Rena made her way to Canada to join her mother, and as of 1994 and the recording of her testimony, she still lived there with her husband and numerous grandchildren. Renas story is one of many in a collection entitled Shards of Memory: Narratives of Holocaust Survival. This volume, edited by Yehudi Lindeman, is part of the Holocaust Video Documentation Archive at McGiIl University known as Living Testimonies. The book offers twenty-five narrative accounts of survivors and one rescuer, all based upon actual video-taped interviews. The book separates the narratives according to the gender of the survivor as well as their particular experience during the Holocaust, whether inside or outside the camps. While these gender differences are not explored specifically in this volume, this has been an area of research and discourse by other Holocaust scholars. In the chapter on women surviving the camps, Rachel G. shares her story of moving from Czechoslovakia to Hungary in 1939, only to find her husband and brother relocated to slave labor camps. Arriving at Auschwitz in 1944, she somehow escaped being killed, only to be forced on a death march and relocated to Ravensbruck and then Malchow. She survived typhus and eventually emigrated to Israel. By 1952, she and her husband and daughter had settled in Montreal. Also a survivor of Auschwitz, Toby Elisabet R., from Slovakia, was eventually transferred with her sisters to the concentration camp known as Stutthof. She barely survived a death march in 1945 when she was shot and left for dead. Also included are the narratives of two sisters, Use Z. and Marti D. who grew up in Amsterdam, where they belonged to the same synagogue as the Frank family. They managed to avoid deportation until 1943 but were soon after deported to Bergen-Belsen. It was here in 1945 that Marti recalls speaking to Anne Frank across the barriers that divided their Lagers. At the end of the war, the sisters returned to Amsterdam only to be shunned by their neighbors, a fate not unlike that of many Jews returning to the Netherlands. All of these women as well as many others commented that they had difficulty speaking of their experiences but they felt they owed it to their children as well as future generations. For many, the Living Testimonies project gave them their first opportunity to share their stories in a supportive environment. Men who survived the camps shared experiences similar to their female counterparts. David A., for example, was born in Hungary and recruited for service in a labor battalion in 1943. After escaping and being recaptured, he was sent to BaIf, a village in the Austro-Hungarian border where sixty percent of the prisoners perished from 1944 to 1945. David was shot and left for dead in what was to be a mass grave only to be rescued hours later by Russian soldiers. Another story is that of Israel B. from Poland, who by 1940 had been moved into the ghetto along with his family. By 1942, the ghetto had been liquidated and all were deported to Treblinka. Israel managed to hide in the ghetto for a while but was eventually captured and sent to a gunpowder factory near Pionki. He eventually landed in Sachsenhausen and was led on a death march. Surviving this was no small miracle, and by 1948, Israel and his new family arrived in Montreal. …', 'year': 2009}, {'paperId': '2dcbc0f8943526cbfd272a7bed060d6c1dbb633b', 'title': 'Bert Dan interview', 'abstract': 'An interview with Bert Dan, a Holocaust \\nsurvivor, conducted by Kay Roth.

Focusing on a case study of a town in southern Poland, Mszana Dolna, the study analyses how Jewish/non-Jewish relations and the history of the Jews of the town are remembered by the current inhabitants of Mszana, as well as by Holocaust survivors and their families. The research is based on an interdisciplinary approach to the subject of memory, using in depth oral history interviews, archival and other written materials, as well as participant observation as sources of analysed data. The study concentrates on the memory of the life in Mszana before, during and after the war in terms of the coexistence of two communities, Jewish and non-Jewish ones. Focusing mainly on the annual commemoration of the shooting of the Jews of Mszana in August 1942 by non-Jewish members of the community and their participation in the educational programmes, the research elucidates the process of regaining the Jewish heritage of the town by non-Jewish inhabitants and incorporating it into the past of the community of Mszana. Identifying the variety of levels of interactions between Jews and non-Jews before the war, it argues that the interrupted coexistence of both groups in Mszana resulted in the void which remained after the destroyed Jewish community. The memory of Jews found its place in the oral history for several decades. Through examining the forms of remembrance of the Jews in Mszana, this study attempts to illustrate the transition of the memory of Jews from private sphere of life to the public discourse on the Jewish inheritance of the town.', 'year': 2016}, {'paperId': '2e6052bcd91dd566233202a8e38f3ba7f3f1d94c', 'title': 'Holocaust Writing of the Second Generation', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2007}, {'paperId': '2ed36e0314b74364fe0b6d3a077d40a0085ae277', 'title': 'Transcending Time to Redeem Humanity: Human Rights Education and the Holocaust', 'abstract': 'This article presents the results of a qualitative, phenomenological case study focused on teachers\\' percep- tions about human rights education in light of the Holocaust.

In the words of one of the artists, the three narratives are “not the Holocaust story you usually see, with camps, guards, and gas chambers” (176). Neither are they there to offer an authoritative account of the past, as many other educational publications have aspired to do. As the three artists tell us in the collaboratively drawn “Behind the Art,” these graphic narratives are ultimately shaped by the individuals involved, not only the survivors but also the graphic novelists themselves. All three emphasize the impact of one’s own family’s past and present on the deeply personal process of scripting and drawing the stories: Libicki’s and Seliktar’s grandparents were Holocaust survivors; Yelin’s grandfather was a member of the SS. Importantly, all three artists have small children, which helped them deepen their connection with their subjects’ childhood personas. But I Live is a work of impressive scope. Given how central the visual and testimonial material is to this book, however, I wish the authors had tackled the specificity of such sources in more detail in the Afterword. For example, it is not entirely accurate that “[m]ost of the visual documentary and documents [sic] we have from the Holocaust are documents produced by perpetrators” (179). In fact, there is ample visual material produced by concentration camp prisoners and Holocaust survivors, including children, that survives to this day. Work by such scholars as Janet Blatter, Sybil Milton, Miriam Novitch, Ziva Amishai-Maisels, Hilary Chute, Stephen Feinstein, Gerald Green, Jörn Wendland, Ella Falldorf, and others explores those sources in detail, while Mor Presiado and Nicholas Stargardt, respectively, pay special attention to drawings by women and children. In a similar vein, the authors argue that earlier video testimonies are “static” and “tend to constrict engagement with survivors” as opposed to foregrounding “the interplay between interviewee and interviewer” (184). Scholars who analyze the medium of video testimony would argue otherwise. Susanne Hillman, for example, demonstrates that the interviewer is central to the shaping of survivor narrative; likewise, “deep listening” practices on the part of the scholar who revisits such sources question the purportedly static nature of the testimony (Hillman, ‘“Not Living, but Going,” Holocaust Studies 21, no. 4 (2015): 215–35).

Literary representations often contain class biases because they rely, almost exclusively, on investigations of middle-class, and urban Jews. Combining textual analysis with oral history methods, I conducted audio-taped interviews with survivors, researched videotaped testimonies as well as unpublished third-person narratives and examined the influence of socioeconomic status on Polish- and German-Jewish women’s everyday lives in the interwar years (1919-38) and during World War II.

As documented by her own writings, by newly published interviews with former students surviving the Holocaust, and by the surviving artwork of children impris oned in Terezin, she used art lessons to improve the quality of life for her students. This article on Dicker-Brandeis is fourfold: 1) to draw par allels between her art education methods and those of Cizek and Itten; 2) to establish her as a progressive educator interested in the whole child; 3) to demonstrate close parallels between her progressive education methods and those of Florence Cane and Natalie Robinson Cole in the United States and Marion Richardson in Great Britain; and 4) to establish her as a Holo caust art educator who brought progressive art education to the children in Terezin. Friedl Dicker-Brandeis (1898-1944), a Bauhaus-trained Jewish artist and art edu cator, who taught art to children in Terezin, a Nazi ghetto camp, provides a powerful legacy of an art educator working under the most heinous conditions during World War II (Makarova, 2001; Hurwitz, 1991). As a ghetto camp located in what is now the Czech Republic 40 miles northwest of Prague, Terezin (also known by its Ger man nameTheresienstadt) was essentially used as a deportation stop for Czech Jews in transit to the death camps in the East. Dicker-Brandeis, along with other inmates trained in arts and letters, created and sustained a rich cultural life in the ghetto camp, including scheduled schooling for the incarcerated children (Hellerstein 1991; Milton, 2000). Her teaching and her life were cut short when she, along with so many other adults and children from Terezin, were transported to Auschwitz, a Nazi death camp, and killed in the gas chambers. Friedl Dicker-Brandeis's legacy of ped agogy can be analyzed through letters and lectures that she wrote, what survivors from Terezin remember about her teach ing, and through the surviving children's artwork, carried out in two suitcases after liberation by Willy Groag, a leader of one of the children's homes (Makarova, 2001). Dicker-Brandeis's art lessons were influ enced by her own training, first by Franz Cizek, whose classes she had attended in Vienna as a youth, and afterwards by her studies with Johannes Itten and other Mas ters of Form at the Bauhaus (1919-1923). The purpose of this article is fourfold: 1) to draw parallels between the art education methods of Dicker-Brandeis in Terezin and those of Cizek and Itten, thus demonstrat ing their influence; 2) to establish Dicker Brandeis as a progressive educator whose interest in the whole child was fostered by Cizek and Itten; 3) to demonstrate that Dicker-Brandeis's pedagogy closely par allels the progressive education methods used by her contemporaries, specifically Florence Cane and Natalie Robinson Cole in the United States, and Marion Richard son in Great Britain; and 4) to establish Friedl Dicker-Brandeis historically as a Holocaust art educator who brought pro gressive art education to the children in Terezin. 92 VISUAL ARTS RESEARCH ? 2006 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois This content downloaded from 157.55.39.143 on Wed, 15 Jun 2016 06:26:40 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\", 'year': 2006}, {'paperId': '319e46596e9753657c708ea09da798e5f714d896', 'title': 'Summative Analysis: A Qualitative Method for Social Science and Health Research', 'abstract': \"In this paper the author describes a new qualitative analytic technique that she has been perfecting across a range of health research studies.

Child Holocaust Survivors and the Development of a Generational Identity', 'abstract': 'In April 1983, the first American Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors brought together thousands of adult survivors, child survivors, and children of survivors in the largest event of its kind ever held. This article explores the role of the Gathering in establishing a sense of generational belonging for child Holocaust survivors: encounters at the Gathering forced child survivors to confront their relationship with the concept of the “survivor”, and it was only after the Gathering that the term “child survivor” entered widespread usage, and the first support groups for child survivors formed. Using oral history collected at the Gathering, in combination with interviews conducted in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the article explores how events such as the Gathering can have a catalytic effect on the development of a generational consciousness. It argues that the construction of generational identities hinges not (or not only) on the formative events of youth, but on an active process of engaging with and narrating a sense of generational belonging that can take place much later in the life cycle. It posits that child survivors only began to see themselves as a distinct group when – in the historical moment of the 1980s – they could locate their experiences in a broader story about who constituted a survivor.', 'year': 2017}, {'paperId': '32bea6f8cd84cff0ad5d30c3fbffb2ce865e55b1', 'title': 'From the Holocaust to Development: reflections of surviving development pioneers', 'abstract': \"Abstract This paper reports on one element of a research project on Holocaust survivors who subsequently became prominent in the emerging field of development studies. Part of the extended interviews with survivors involved retrospective reflections on the evolution and current state of their branch of development studies. This material, augmented by an interrogation of their published work, provides fascinating ‘insider’ perspectives on the kaleidoscope of changing ideologies, theories, discourses, policies and practices subsumed under the label of ‘development’. While the particular nature of this set of interviewees calls for caution in generalising from the findings, they appear far less unrepresentative than might be imagined, both because the subjects are diverse in terms of nationality, age, socialisation, wartime experiences and subsequent career tracks, and because they forged prominent contributions to, and were shaped by, the evolving Zeitgeist of development during an era when its imperative was virtually unquestioned. The paper incorporates interviewees' own voices, interpreting their perspectives in terms of their personal characteristics and positionalities and in relation to contemporaneous development debates. It thus contributes both to the history/archaeology of development and to ongoing critical debates about its nature.\", 'year': 2009}, {'paperId': '32eb4c6c91d6c05363c1abaabf7e4075f8316238', 'title': '“Nature Was Helping Us”: Forests, Trees, and Environmental Histories of the Holocaust', 'abstract': 'This article explores what environmental history might contribute to the field of holocaust and genocide studies (and environmental histories of genocide might contribute to the field of environmental histories of war) through examining the complex ways nature functioned materially and imaginatively during the Holocaust and its postwar telling. Drawing on both published and unpublished memoirs and oral history interviews with Jews who survived the war hiding in the forests of central and eastern Europe, the article examines three main tensions. First, they experienced the woods as a disorienting, alien, and alienating world, and yet an escape from a more corrupt world outside the forest. Second, nature was both something to be worked with and adapted to given its benevolent role while also being seen as insufficient and therefore in need of supplementing in order to survive. Third, adapting to nature—or becoming “animal” as a number of survivors put it—was both assertion of successful survival and a way of explaining and distancing self from wartime behavior in the forest.

It reports on an exploratory study that examines: the criteria searchers of oral history interviews use when judging the relevance of a recording or a passage; the attributes on which those judgments are based; the moves searchers adopt for information need refinements (INR); and the types of query reformulation by which those moves are realized. Eight participants that include faculty, Holocaust scholars, a film producer, and a high school teacher searched the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation's collection that consists of 116,000 hours of 52,000 testimonies in 32 different languages from the survivors, liberators, rescuers and witnesses of the Holocaust. Each participant performed a series of searches based on his/her own interests over a period of three to nine days. Data were collected through observation and screen capture, think aloud, semi-structured interviews, and focus group discussions; coded; and analyzed by looking for patterns. The cognitive process of relevance judgment and query reformulation occurred interactively during a search. As a result, some relevance criteria (topicality, comprehensibility, novelty of content, and acquaintance) and INR moves (clarification alone, specialization, restriction, and note for later) were observed during both processes. Some criteria, such as richness and emotion, were medium (i.e., speech) and domain (i.e., oral history) specific. The findings identified four different types of attributes of a recording or a passage that included spoken-content attributes (person, place, event/experience, organization/group, ...), audio and/or visual attributes (facial expression, voice, gesture, displayed artifact, ...), non-content attributes (cache, digitization, language, ...), and biographical attributes (name of interviewee, date of birth, gender, occupation, ...). Searchers used different query reformulation types, such as adding a condition, narrowing a condition, new term, broadening a condition, removing a condition, and modifying a condition, in order to achieve different INR moves. Some important implications for indexing and metadata assignment, support for search and browsing, and task-oriented system and interface design are drawn from the findings.

Those “mixed-race” Germans were sterilized after the Nazis came to power and many died in concentration camps. This is one of the few accounts of the fate of Blacks not only in Germany proper but also in the pre-World War I colonies. The only other book that has engaged the subject is by Hans J. Massaquoi, Destined to Witness: Growing Up Black in Nazi Germany, a memoir about growing up in Hamburg as an Afro-German in the Nazi era. However, Bilé, a journalist for RFO, creates a very readable account that joins together pieces of the German experience in Africa and with Africans. Using interviews with Black survivors, Bilé has created an engaging text, although one that is thin on analysis. Germany’s first bad experiences came with its African colonies, principally German Southwest Africa (Namibia), German East Africa, Togo, and Cameroon. Namibia was the site of the first documented genocide of the twentieth century when General von Trotha ordered the extermination of the native Herero and Nama peoples after a failed uprising. This is a genocide which the Federal Republic of Germany recognized in 2006 and is the subject of much scholarly interest. However, Bilé’s analysis reveals other aspects of the many problems that developed in the German colonial experience because of a parallel development of race theory. This ideology of racial purity for whites created considerable opposition by colonial officials and even missionaries about mixed marriages and mixed-race births. Although Germany lost all of its colonies by the terms of the Versailles Treaty, the rise of race theory and eugenics ultimately created what German doctors feared would be a public health menace. When Hitler came to power, all mixed marriages between “Aryans” and other races were forbidden and existing marriages annulled. As with the case of Jewish persecution, Black Germans were excluded from schools and youth movements. Forced sterilization of mixed-race blacks intensified under Sonderkommando 3 in 1937. When World War II started, the incarceration processes affected non-German Blacks, such as the American musician Arthur Briggs, interned after the occupation of France at Saint Denis, The presence of Black American GIs in allied armies scared the Nazis so much that the rules of the Geneva Convention were violated by a long list of summary executions. However, there were some exceptions. Josef Nassy, a Black artist born in Surinam and a naturalized American, was detained in the camp at Laufen, was not persecuted, and was allowed to paint. Nassy and all of his art survived, now in the collection of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Bilé’s book is filled with countless stories of Blacks, especially with a French colonial nationality connection, who wound up in concentration camps, often to live to tell the tale. One wishes these accounts might be longer because of the countries of origin of some of these victims: Haiti, Martinique, Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea, and Congo. Within this strange world of camps, Bilé has two interesting stories, one of Blanchette, the only black woman deported to Ravensbrück, and Hugo, a Black Kapo in Auschwitz. Bilé ends his account on a high note, with the stories of American Black GI’s who were involved in the liberation of some concentration camps but also fought in a segregated army.', 'year': 2007}, {'paperId': '34e4aa26c8003a955061d3453d885668f02ab0a1', 'title': 'Recovering and rendering silenced experiences of genocides: Testimonial fragments of the Holocaust', 'abstract': '\\n The experiences of murdered victims of Nazi persecutions perished with them.

In 2003 he famously debated Tarik Ramadan, a Swiss academic who is a grandson of Hassan el Banna, founder of the Muslim Brotherhood. In the debate, Ramadan accused Finkielkraut of Islamophobia and \"communautarism,\" (a euphemism for Jewish tribalism). Often reviled for his openly pro-Israeli views and his concern for the negative impact of immigration on French culture and identity, Finkielkraut is now at the center of a media storm following the recent publication of his latest book The Unhappy Identity. This volume considers the national identity of France, the country in which Finkielkraut was born and raised. A week prior the publication of The Unhappy Identity, the mainstream weekly, Le Point, devoted the cover and most of its issue to this philosopher.2 In the same issue Ghaleb Bencheikh, former president ofthe Great Mosque ofParis who today chairs the \"World Conference of Religions for Peace\" and hosts the television show \"&/In addition to having been interviewed widely by the media, Finkielkraut also has been insulted and subjected to violent rants because of what is perceived as his scathing attack on immigration, and more specifically on Muslim immigration. Yet this is not what the book is about. While it cannot be denied that the philosopher sees in that immigration the seeds of destruction for French culture, his view is not related to the religion of the immigrants; rather, it related to his belief that they refuse to be integrated into the fabric of French society and that they are destroying it from within. Popular French journalist Frederic Martel unfairly quipped that Unhappy Identity is in fact \"...the unhappy book of a man who no longer likes himself.3\" That is not true. Finkielkraut is indeed unhappy, but that is because he mourns the disintegration of the country that he knows and loves, that is, the loss of its traditions and its values. In a nostalgic introduction, Finkielkraut writes of his youth in post-war France and the great expectations of May 1968, when students shared the heady belief that they could change the world. He mourns what he sees as contemporary loss of hope, and also that France is changing in a manner opposed to the will of its native population. Europe, he says, is becoming \"A continent of immigration...Change is no longer what we are doing or what we are aspiring to, change is what is happening to us ... and what is happening... is the integration crisis.\"4Integration-or rather the lack of it-and its impact on French tradition and culture forms the core of the book, whose six chapters are replete with quotations ranging from Hobbes to Tocqueville, Levy-Strauss, and Barres to Hanna Arendt. The new immigrants insist on observing their religion in public spaces even when doing so is illegal. In fact, says Finkielkraut, \"For the first time in the history of immigration, those who are hosted refused to those who host themwhoever they may be - the right to represent the host country.5\"Finkielkraut considers that this development would not have taken place without some unlikely supporters who saw the intrusion of religion and religious practices in everyday life from an unexpected angle. In his view, it started with a clash of ideas between two groups of secular thinkers. …', 'year': 2013}, {'paperId': '371cde822dc42cdfd8849f7a18b3c41b6454751d', 'title': 'Simon Kalmas (Shimon Yosef Kalmus) Interview', 'abstract': 'An interview with Simon J.

The so-called privileged Jews include prisoners in the Nazi-operated camps and ghettos who held positions that gave them access to material and other benefits, while compelling them to act in ways that have been judged detrimental to fellow inmates. Although the issue of \"privileged\" Jews has been largely neglected, it relates to a crucial facet of the Holocaust and has vast implications for its aftermath. The ethical dilemmas facing these victims may be closely linked to what Lawrence Langer has termed choiceless choices, which challenge conventional notions of \"judgment\" and \"responsibility.\" This problem is also the primary subject of Auschwitz survivor Primo Levi’s essay titled \"The Grey Zone,\" which is arguably the most influential essay ever written on the Holocaust. Levi argues that one should abstain from judging individuals who confronted such extreme circumstances, positioning prisoners with \"privileged\" positions at the threshold of representation and understanding. However, moral evaluations of \"privileged\" Jews have a strong impact on Holocaust testimonies, whether these were constructed during the war or recorded long after the survivors’ experiences. The examples of video testimonies explored in this article reveal that this is particularly the case when interviewees are former \"privileged\" Jews and interviewers are themselves Holocaust survivors. The article argues that when confronted with such an emotionally and morally fraught issue, judgment may itself be seen as a \"limit of representation.\"', 'year': 2009}, {'paperId': '385af6f13a895b0b5870babf73c603b1c2e2d589', 'title': 'Die Künste der Nachkriegszeit: Musik, Literatur und Bildende Kunst in Österreich ed. by Stefan Schmidl (review)', 'abstract': 'Hauff writes: “Mit dieser Selbstdefi nition brachte er seine Schuld als jüdischer Funktionär zum Ausdruck, eine aufgrund der Zwangssituation determinierte Schuld” (308).

A qualitative phenomenological methodology was implemented through an in-depth analysis and interpretation of data collected through a direct interview with Eva and through published material of her personal accounts. Findings indicate that this case is unique not only in its remarkability but also in the human process it reveals: a life-changing conversion with the lasting effects of high levels of interpersonal, intrapersonal, and spiritual integration.

However, their works are further distinguished by acute examinations that probe the moral fabric of Israeli society itself, including dehumanization of the enemy through slogans and other debased forms of language and misuses of historical memory. In addition, their fiction measures the distance between the suffering and pain of intimate family memory (what Semel once dubbed their “private Shoah”) and ceremonial, nationalistic forms of Holocaust memory, and the apartness felt by the children of survivors who sense themselves somehow at odds with their society’s heroic values. Semel’s numerous articles, and fiction as well as nonfiction books, frequently address second and third-generation trauma, arguably most impressively in her harrowing five-part novel And the Rat Laughed (2001) that spans 150 years but most crucially juxtaposes the experiences of a “hidden child” in a remote wartime Polish village repeatedly raped with that of her grandchild writing a dutiful report for her class in contemporary Israel.

Based on empirical data, I want to provide a closer look at these specific stressors. About the background: According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), there are currently nearly 26.4 million refugees, about half of them are under the age of 18. A majority of them have been exposed to multiple traumatic experiences, such as internal displacement, extreme violence, and torture. Meeting the needs of this vulnerable group is a major challenge for host countries and is often covered by professional helpers or volunteers. Since helpers are repeatedly confronted with severe trauma of the primary victims, they often are affected themselves. The effect of secondary trauma stress is already established in scientific literature and documented in the DSM-5. What is still lacking in terms of conceptualization are two main aspects: Firstly, traumatized refugees do not only suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) but their traumatization is much more complex. Clinical trauma research often runs the risk to cut the consequences of war and flight too short. According to this, I would like to introduce the concept of sequential traumatization as an alternative approach for understanding traumatization in this context. Originally coming from a study of holocaust survivors, it describes trauma as an ongoing and long-lasting process and thus contrasts with the concept of post-traumatic stress disorder. Among other aspects the formulation of sequential traumatization integrates decreased resilience, cultural as well as socio-economical aspects of trauma. And secondly, refugee helpers are therefore not only confronted with primary victim PTSD, but also the more complex form of sequential trauma. That means, their stressors cannot be separated from a range of socio-political and societal conditions. The Helpers may face secondary sequential traumatic stress (SSTS). Our research question focuses on these specific stressors caused by confrontation with sequential trauma. Eighteen interviews were conducted with supporters in the context of flight and asylum. According to our results helpers have to deal with fears, excessive demands as well as with feelings of guilt, ambiguities of hope and despair and the endurance of uncertainty and injustice. In addition to empathy and direct confrontation with trauma, it is above all social approaches and political decisions that make supporters feel angry, powerless and helpless in the context of war, flight and, asylum.\"', 'year': 2022}, {'paperId': '3c948c7b0cd2292cdb58e824eb35e1a8cb6f9bca', 'title': '\"You\\'ve Never Seen this Kind of Poverty\": Facing Class and Gender in Shoah Representations', 'abstract': \"In researchers' reconstructions of the Holocaust, also called the Shoah, the lives of ordinary people l lives more impoverished and constrained than those of middle- and upper-class individuals - have been largely overlooked.

Literary representations often contain class biases because they rely, almost exclusively, on investigations of middle-class, and urban Jews. Combining textual analysis with oral history methods, I conducted audio-taped interviews with survivors, researched videotaped testimonies as well as unpublished third-person narratives and examined the influence of socioeconomic status on Polish- and German-Jewish women's everyday lives in the interwar years (1919-38) and during World War II.

In the past decade, a number of excellent regional studies have provided important insights into the events of the Holocaust at the local level and the nature of German occupation policy in the East. Thomas Sandkühler’s and Dieter Pohl’s works on the German administration in Galicia and Christian Gerlach’s massive study of German occupation policies in Belorussia offer some of the most outstanding examples. Likewise, Wendy Lower’s first-rate study of the Zhytomyr region provides an important contribution to the existing scholarship and serves as a welcome complement to Karel Berkhoff’s work on Ukraine. In addition to incorporating a broad range of secondary sources, Lower expertly leverages an impressive collection of primary sources: local Ukrainian archival holdings, memoirs and diaries, interviews conducted with survivors of the German occupation, and materials from captured German document collections and former Soviet archives. The author’s command of this literature makes it possible for her to present a detailed and nuanced picture of the occupation in the Zhytomyr region during the period 1941–1944, including the everyday experiences of Jews, non-Jewish Ukrainians, the ethnic German population, and the various agencies and organizations of the German administration. Her depiction of the issues, challenges, opportunities, and dangers faced by each of these groups at the grass-roots level constitutes one of the major strengths of the work. Despite her focus on the expression of National Socialist rule in the Zhytomyr region, Lower also traces the relationship of specific Nazi initiatives in the region to their broader historical and contemporary influences. On the one hand, Lower argues that Hitler’s conception of Ukraine as a “Garden of Eden” or the “California of Europe” must be seen through the prism of a long tradition of European imperialism. In light of that tradition, the region emerged as an object of Nazi desire based on an admixture of “völkisch utopian fantasies, the Lebensraum tradition of continental migration, and the imperialistic Weltpolitik of economic exploitation” (p. 24). On the other hand, Lower describes the ways in which German administrators, the Wehrmacht, and SS and police authorities on the periphery pursued the goals and objectives emanating from the center. While Adolf Hitler, Heinrich Himmler, and Reinhard Heydrich established policy aims and constructed an administrative apparatus to achieve them, “the process of persecution and methods of mass murder developed from the ground up” (p. 158). In this respect, the cooperation and collaboration of the entire occupation structure in the destruction of Ukraine’s Jewish population highlights the general agreement from top to bottom concerning a “final solution to the Jewish Question.” Lower demonstrates that in contrast to the great degree of consensus achieved for the', 'year': 2008}, {'paperId': '3d2ddcf2f104d1c069ebeadee2acbf5c08495cba', 'title': 'In the shadow of Moses: New Jewish movements in Africa and the Diaspora', 'abstract': '1949,” Polin 20 (2007): 98–121. 18..

Le Vine Emeritus, Washington University in St. Louis First, in the interest of full disclosure and in deference to the authors of this essay, I admit to having reviewed the article last year and advising the editors of the African Studies Review not to publish it. I do, however, applaud their decision to make it available-with minor revisions by the authors-for open discussion in these pages and therefore agreed to add my comments to those of other reviewers. Two considerations prompted my negative review: one was what I saw were shortcomings in the analysis due to a failure to address the larger contextual issues raised by the original question, and the other, the willingness of the authors, in my view unwarranted, to accept the conjunction of Jewish Holocaust reparations with the demands for reparations for slavery and colonialism. My reading of the revised manuscript confirmed my earlier judgment, particularly with reference to the latter problem, raising serious questions about the authors\\' analytic logic and arguments. My comments focus on these matters. The authors are certainly correct in concluding that success in reparations claims \"depends to large extent on how the claim for reparations is framed.\" They then proceed to point out that the Jewish claims were successful because the event from which claims arose was comparatively recent, that survivors of the Holocaust, or members of their immediate families, or the families of victims, were/are present to make the claims; that appeals for compensatory justice resonated with those with strong moral convictions about genocide-or with residual feelings of guilt about the event. (It should be added the Holocaust itself, as a unique event, had a worldwide audience, at least after the end of World War II, to whom the appeal could be directed.) So far so good. The problem is that the original question, put as \"Why Africans can\\'t imitate Jews?\" and also as \"Why did the Jews obtain reparations, yet we can\\'t?\" is itself a complex loaded question (in logic, it begs the question) which presupposes definite answers to a previous set of unstated, loaded questions, such as (here), Q: \"Is the Holocaust the moral equivalent of slavery, or colonialism?\" A: Yes. Q. \"Are not Africans as worthy of compensation for their collective injury, as were the Jews for theirs?\" A: Yes. Q: \"Should the Jews be privileged in getting reparations over Africans demanding compensation for the injury they suffered? A: No. All of these unstated questions and answers (which can also be restated as unstated premises) are worth examining on their own merits for the attitudes they imply and the historical-ideological context(s) in which they were raised. That is not, however, the analytical path taken by the authors: they accept the original question as their point of departure without looking at its implications or premises. In short, the original question, used as die conundrum for investigation, violates at least one canon of scientific inquiry: you cannot use a loaded question as the basis of analysis, at least not until it is rephrased without its hidden overload. Without losing the import of the authors\\' argument, or vitiating their conclusions, how could the issues they raise be put as a valid question(s) for analysis? For example, \"How have African demands for reparations been framed, and why?\" \"Can Jewish claims for Holocaust reparations be compared to African claims involving slavery and colonialism? If so, how? If not, why not?\" Once stated without its load, the main question could then subsume reasonable discussion of the comparative success (or lack thereof) of the Holocaust and \"black\" reparations campaigns. One further reservation directed at the authors\\' methodology. This study is based on \"seventy-five interviews with African ambassadors, academics, policymakers, and human rights activists, many [of whom] indicated awareness of the precedent of reparations to Jews. …', 'year': 2007}, {'paperId': '3d94b8433072adc4957bbe8075dc8cd08b5750a0', 'title': 'Psychiatry, Testimony, and Shoah', 'abstract': \"Summary A1999 examination of approximately 5000 long-term psychiatric patients in Israel identified 725 as Holocaust (Shoah) survivors.

We interviewed 24 siblings from 11 families who were adult children of Holocaust survivors, alongside the experience of the first author (IK), also a child of Holocaust survivors. An interpretative phenomenological analysis of those interviews identified two overarching themes related to the motivation to gather information about their parents’ stories and their experience of seeking this knowledge. Two themes relate to motivation. The first captured a sense of immersion without choice in the family story emanating from extreme loss and grief and a deep awareness of the communal nature of Jewish history. The second theme encompassed a compulsion and desire to leave a meaningful legacy of their parents’ experiences for future generations. These themes were linked to themes capturing the experience of engaging with their parents’ traumatic stories and describing intense ambivalence. One theme reflected a reluctance to gather information detailing the parents’ trauma. Yet, the other theme emphasised positive outcomes derived from knowledge, including appreciation of their parents’ resilience and opportunities to bear witness to and support their ageing parents.

Due to the lack of awareness, proximity to Israeli Holocaust museums, and large groups of survivors outside of Israel, very little research and interviewing was done on Sephardic and Mizrahi Jewry in WWII and the exposure of the Jews of the Balkans, North Africa, the Middle East and the Far East to the Holocaust. In this process, the Holocaust history of Morocco and Iraq was virtually known outside of Israel. Since for many decades after the Holocaust Ashkenazi hegemony emphasized heroism and resistance in its narrative, when Sephardic research addressed Jewish partisan resistance in the Balkans, and in Auschwitz and other labor and death camps, it was blocked from the general historiography and museum commemoration. In the last two decades, the Holocaust establishment has been including Sephardic Jewry and other non-Ashkenazi groups in Africa and Asia in its narrative at best as a token element.

The chaplains were among the first liberators to meet the survivors in Europe and to send reports to American Jews. This information, supplemented by accounts from American soldiers and journalists helped shape American Jewish response to the former victims. Grobman documents the activities of chaplains in responding to the desperate needs of postwar Jewish refugees. Although the U.S. Army was responsible for the welfare of the survivors, the army did not always understand the problems of Jewish survivors, and the chaplains mediated with official military bodies to meet those needs. In addition to offering spiritual guidance, providing food, and escorting refugees to better conditions and, eventually to Palestine, the chaplains informed American authorities and the American Jewish community about the plight of displaced persons and helped organize the displaced persons as an independent political force. This critical and controversial study examines not only the adequacy of the response by the U.S. government and military to the survivors, but also the American Jewish response. Grobman concludes that the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC), the Jewish organization most responsible for providing aid to the survivors, did not adequately respond. Both the failure of the American Jewish community to donate sufficient funds to the JDC and of American Jewish social workers to volunteer in significant numbers for duty as JDC representatives in Europe, severely hampered rescue efforts.

This essay attempts to listen contrapuntally to one documentary source concerned with Viktor Ullmann’s musical activities in Terezín: Goethe och Ghetto (1996), the award-winning film directed by Peter Berggren and Göran Rosenberg. My analysis places the original witness testimonies collected for the project in contrapuntal conversation with the final documentary to illuminate its intentional “voicing” of three survivors as well as the power dynamics inherent in the testimonial exchange.

Biographical narrative interviews be they focused on the 'Third Reich' or on life history produce long, epic and dramatic stories about war. The Second World War is still undoubtedly a private as well as a public theme which is frequently and easily expanded upon, with seemingly few problems of memory. One explanation of this phenomenon is that important and widely experienced historical events, or phases which have had extreme and painful effects upon the everyday lives of people in a certain region or country, generate narration. Common experience and suffering leads it is assumed to the formation of groups in which common stories and myths are traditionalized. Where this process has occurred, as we will assume it did for World War n, then it is possible to externalize former suffering, to distance oneself from it and to cause the pain to recede into the background, possibly with the help of anecdotes.1 Yet although the narration-generative effect of the collective suffering and experience of World War II has an empirical basis,2 it is quite impossible to maintain this assumption in general. While it may be possible to argue that some sort of togetherness is created by narrators,3 the converse assumption that togetherness produces narration applies only to specific structures of experience. In fact, two empirical examples show by contrast that painful events which are commonly experienced can become inexpressible. For many people who were persecuted by the National Socialists, who were in hiding during WW II or were forced into ghettos, or who survived concentration and extermination camps, a great deal of effort is necessary for remembering and narration. Since their liberation, a few have spoken frequently of their experiences, but the vast majority have tried to forget. Among those who are beginning to speak now, and who are trying to remember the crimes committed against them, many have narration gaps and are almost completely unable to give themselves over to a stream of narration or to a re-living of experience. While the narration difficulties of these people are partly due to the traumatization they have undergone, another factor is revealed by analysis of the narrations of bystanders and perpetrators of national socialism: the partial speechlessness of the victims contrasts to the verbosity of the non-persecuted German, whose narrations serve, paradoxically, not to uncover the injustice of the national socialist system and their own involvement in it, but to cover it up with stories. Holocaust survivors, on the other hand, want to talk about their traumatic experiences as a reaction against tendencies to forget Nazi crimes, and against the thesis of the 4Auschwitz-Lie', but their experiences are so much more difficult to relate. For persecuted and non-persecuted Germans the possibilities of narration about the period of National Socialism depend upon different, and differently realisable, social functions of remembering. My second example is that of veterans of World War I who say hardly anything about their experiences in the trenches. Common soldiers who had little part in the creation of the literature of the war are especially notable for speaking very little about their time at the front.4 WW I in no way resembles WW II in the generation of narration. The presentation of the former in speech is confined to images, metaphors and limited reports about personal experiences.5 The difference in the verbal presentation of the two wars is connected to differences in the conditions for experience of the wars, and above all to the contrast between a war of immobility and a war of mobility. In this article I wish to discuss the thesis that the narrability of WW II that is, the structural possibility of generating narrations about the war experience during the period of National Socialism, and the accompanying readiness to narrate is conditional upon the structure of the war experience, the biographical necessity for narration, and its social function for the Germans. My argument is based on analyses of biographical narrations which were gained in various projects.6 In one collective project, 'Biographical Working Through of War Experiences', my colleagues and I examined 21 non-persecuted witnesses of the Third Reich born in the years 1890-1930. 7 1 will also consider another 15 interviews I conducted with men\", 'year': 2016}, {'paperId': '406265a65c4613c12a96c0d05d32a1adf080e91d', 'title': \"Implications of the Holocaust for eating and weight problems among survivors' offspring: an exploratory study\", 'abstract': \"This paper explores the proposition that Holocaust survivors' experiences of deprivation and trauma influenced the development of eating and weight problems among their offspring.

What is less known is how the genocide affected the offspring of these survivors. From my own interviews with members of the Armenian-American “second generation,” many of whom are now in their 80s and 90s (those born in the 1920s and 1930s), and my examination of the few scholarly articles that have delved into this issue, I argue that there was indeed a transfer of trauma from one generation to the next. In addition, I argue that the extensive scholarship within the Jewish community, both in Israel and in the Jewish diaspora, on how the Holocaust has impacted the offspring of that genocide, can teach us much about the transgenerational passing of trauma with regard to the Armenian Genocide. Finally, I examine how the issue of genocide denial has also impacted the second generation. Survivors of the Armenian Genocide were generally women and children, as men were the first to be killed (either while they were conscripts in the Ottoman Army or in their ancestral villages in the Armenian Plateau or in other parts of Anatolia). Survivors, particularly those who endured the forced exile march to the Syrian Desert, endured beatings and rape, witnessed family members brutally killed by gendarmes or “chetes”—criminals set loose on the caravans—and saw remaining family members die of starvation or dehydration. Those who survived these death marches were able to settle in the Arab countries, or emigrate chiefly to France, the United States, or various countries in South America after the end of World War I. Tens of thousands of such survivors were able to come to the shores of America between the end of the war in 1918 and 1924, at which time discriminatory immigration laws were imposed on people coming from certain “undesirable” regions like Southern and Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Through Armenian compatriotic societies and other associations, many marriages took place during this time between Armenian bachelors who had come to America before World War I to work in the factories and the women refugees.

Dir. Esdier Hoffenberg. New York: First Run / Icarus Films, 2005. 85 min. Color. $440.00, sale of video or DVD. $125.00, rental of video.', 'abstract': 'In this intriguing film, Esdier Hoffenberg, a French Jewish director, attempts to understand her mother\\'s past life. Although Eva Lamprecht was born in Poland, her family was German. Eva\\'s father, Alexander, owned a large paper factory in Sosnowiec; he continued to run die factory during the Nazi years. After the war, Eva married Stas, ajewish survivor, and converted to Judaism; she did so, the film notes, with all the \"rigor of her Protestant upbringing.\" The couple moved to France. There, Eva essentially buried her German past. But in the 1970s, Eva had repeated nervous breakdowns. The film argues diat Eva\\'s mental illness resulted from being ashamed of her German heritage. In order to understand her mother\\'s illness, Hoffenberg set out to learn about Eva\\'s early life. She recorded her mother\\'s vague recollections. She interviewed relatives and friends who had known Eva in Poland. She sifted through many family documents, including old letters, family photo albums, and home movies. In die film, Hoffenberg is quite creative in presenting these family artifacts. At times, for example, she runs a magnifying glass over old photos so that they appear to be in motion. Hoffenberg, however, is not free of Holocaust cliches; she tape-records her mother while they are traveling on a train. What did Hoffenberg learn? As a young woman, Eva was \"beautiful\" and \\'Vibrant,\" a real head turner. She led a life typical of Germans in Nazi-occupied Poland: she went to a German school, sang the Horst Wessel song, and served in the Reichsarbeitsdienst. Toward the end of the war, she worked closely with her father in the paper factory. The Lamprechts were complicit with the Nazis in the sense that they kept their factory open during the German occupation. But diey did not participate in the Nazis\\' more heinous crimes. What caused Eva\\'s illness? The film offers a few hints that Eva was preoccupied with Nazi crimes during the postwar years. At one point, for example, she went to considerable lengdis to determine the camps in which a Jewish high school friend had been imprisoned. But the film gives few other examples of Eva being obsessed with the German occupation or die Holocaust. Instead, the material presented suggests that Eva\\'s mental condition may have been caused by the many family traumas she experienced. Before the war, her mother, Gisela, a sculptress, had a love affair with a close family friend. During the war, Eva lost both her brother Lolek and her sister Nina. After die war, Gisela left both Alexander and Poland; Alexander, however, stayed in Sosnowiec. Eva had always been her father\\'s favorite, but after the war she had litde contact with him. Alexander even disinherited Eva shordy before his death in 1963—supposedly because she had married ajew. In France, Eva led the typical, isolated life of a middle-class wife. While her husband worked as an electrical engineer, she took care of their four children. As if all this were not enough, Eva\\'s oldest daughter died of breast cancer in 1983 (well after Eva first exhibited signs of serious depression). Certainly, Eva\\'s life was inexorably shaped by events rooted in the Nazi era. But did her inability to master her German past unleash her mental illness? Or were her wrenching family losses to blame? Eva never comes into focus in this film. Her words are vague; the picture and movies often grainy; she never looks directly at her daughter. This is, of course, in keeping with the film\\'s theme. As one interviewee stated, Eva always remained behind a \"hidden curtain.\" Who was the real Eva? We do not know. And the same is true of much else: Did Eva have something to hide about her German past? Did she ever resolve the issues of her past? Why did Alexander stay in Poland? Why did he disinherit Eva? This film beautifully documents the twists and turns of a life shaped by the upheaval of mid-twentieth-century Europe. But die film\\'s main contention—that Eva\\'s shame about her first life brought on the mental illness of her second—is open to question. Ultimately, The Two Lives of Eva is more evocative dian convincing: it may have happened that way, but it may just as well have not.', 'year': 2007}, {'paperId': '432bcf27fdc0d97236137551f506dd1607a85d8d', 'title': 'The Experience of Being a Hidden Child Survivor of the Holocaust', 'abstract': 'Child survivors of the Holocaust have only recently been recognized as a distinguishable group of individuals who survived the war with a different experience to the older survivors. This thesis focuses on a specific group of child survivors, those who survived by going into hiding. In hiding, some remained “visible” by hiding within convents, orphanages or with Christian families. Others were physically hidden and had to disappear from sight. Most children often combined these two experiences in their hiding. The intent of this study was to explore the experience of these hidden children using Giorgi’s empirical phenomenological methodology and to gain a richer understanding of the nature of this experience. Phenomenological analyses of the recorded and transcribed interviews of 11 child survivors were conducted and organized into meaning units which subsequently yielded situated structures from which the general structures evolved. These analyses revealed that the defining moment of being hidden for these children was the suppression of their identities as Jews. By being hidden, they had to deny the essence of their core selves, including their names, family details and connections to others in an effort to conceal their Jewishness. Other structures to emerge as part of hiding were the pervading fear which enveloped their entire experience in hiding and the sense of suspended normality during this period, which sometimes extended over a period of years. A “cut-offness” and personality constriction seemed to be present throughout the descriptions of these children and appears to have developed as a method of coping with the trauma of their childhood. Overlaying all of this were general insecurities about the capriciousness of the war and the contextual specifics of their actual hiding places to which each child had to adjust. Connections/relationships to another person seemed to be highly significant in the dynamics of the everyday during the experience of hiding and often shaped some of the psychological and emotional experiences of hiddenness.', 'year': 2009}, {'paperId': '43485768e7b078de500c705906537cee48746b84', 'title': 'Jméno: jeho změna, ztráta a navrácení v rozhovorech s židovskými přeživšími holocaustu', 'abstract': 'This article aims to explore the personal name as an aspect of human identity, based on our analysis of several tens of oral-history autobiographical interviews from the USC Shoah Foundation’s Visual History Archive (http://vhaonline.usc.edu).

Our research points to the tendency to understand name and identity as an indivisible duality, which is mutually influenced. At the same time, it suggests that the loss of name or its compulsory change is not reflected by the survivors as an especially traumatic experience, in the context of following events.

To investigate this issue, we interviewed 121 Croatian war veterans diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) about amnesia, intrusions (i.e., flashbacks and nightmares), and the sensory qualities of their most horrific war memories. Additionally, they completed a self-report scale measuring dissociative experiences. In contrast to what one would expect on the basis of theories emphasizing the special status of traumatic memories, amnesia and high frequency intrusions were not particularly typical for our sample of traumatized individuals. Moreover, traumatic memories were not qualitatively different from neutral memories with respect to their stability and sensory qualities. The severity of PTSD symptoms was not significantly correlated with dissociative experiences. Our findings do not support the existence of special memory mechanisms that are unique to experiencing traumatic events. I N T R O D U C T I O N In clinical literature, there is little consensus about how victims remember traumatic experiences (e.g., Kihlstrom, 2004; Loftus, 1997b; McNally, 2003a). According to one popular view, memories of traumatic events have special properties that distinguish them from ordinary memories. Thus, many authors have argued that traumatic memories are qualitatively different from other types of memories, involving unique mechanisms not related to general memory functioning (e.g., van der Kolk, 1996, 1997; for a review, see Zoellner & Bittenger, 2004). For example, these authors assume that traumatic events are processed in a predominantly perceptual fashion, leaving survivors with traumatic memories that are not readily accessible (i.e., dissociative or psychogenic amnesia) and/or flashbacks that possess strong sensory qualities. This dissociative style of processing would also create a substantial overlap between dissociative and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. There are several versions of this theoretical stance (Brewin, Dalgleish & Joseph, 1996; Ehlers & Clark, 2000), but the core assumption they have in common is that trauma has a special impact on the way in which memories of the traumatic event are organized. For that reason, this position has been dubbed the traumaTRAUMATIC WAR MEMORIES 37 memory argument (for a balanced discussion, see Kihlstrom, 1996, in press; Shobe & Kihlstrom, 1997; for a reply, see Nadel & Jacobs, 1998). Although the trauma-memory argument has gained popularity among many clinicians, some findings argue against this view. As Pendergrast (1998) has pointed out, classic monographs like those of Spiegel and colleagues (Grinker & Spiegel, 1943/1945; Kardiner & Spiegel, 1941/1947) include only isolated case reports of soldiers suffering from amnesia (see also Lilienfeld & Loftus, 1998). Moreover, more systematic studies suggest that only a small minority of war victims report dissociative amnesia. For example, Kuch and Cox (1992) studied 124 holocaust survivors and found that dissociative amnesia, with an estimated lifetime prevalence rate of 3.2%, was quite rare in this group. Likewise, Merckelbach and colleagues (Merckelbach, Dekkers, Wessel, & Roefs, 2003a, 2003b) found in a group of 29 Dutch concentration camp survivors only one survivor reporting mnemonic experiences that might be taken as evidence for dissociative amnesia1. Goodman and co-workers found that 15.5% of victims of documented childhood sexual abuse (CSA) failed to report the target incident during a telephone interview conducted approximately 13 years after the pertinent events (Goodman, Ghetti, Quas, Edelstein, Alexander et al., 2003; Goodman & Paz-Alonso, in press). However, nondisclosure dropped to 8.3% after follow-up by a mailed questionnaire and a telephone interview2. Both rates of reporting failure are clearly lower than those found in earlier, less meticulous studies of CSA victims (e.g., Williams, 1994). Even when one accepts these lower rates of non-reporting, the question arises to what extent they do reflect genuine dissociative amnesia. People might not report the traumatic events for other reasons than amnesia (e.g., shame, ordinary forgetting; see McNally, 2003a). Recent literature is also critical about the idea that traumatic memories invariantly produce flashbacks. For example, using patient archives, Jones and colleagues showed that flashbacks were an uncommon symptom in generations of British war veterans before the 1980’s (Jones, Vermaas, McCartney, Beech, Palmer et al., 2003). So far, empirical support for the trauma-memory argument is not very compelling. On the other hand, the studies cited above suffer from various shortcomings and thus, one could argue that they provide only suboptimal tests of the trauma-memory argument. One shortcoming is that it is not always clear whether the events (e.g., war experiences) were really traumatic to the participants (Jones et al., 2003). Another limitation is that the traumatic events', 'year': 2006}, {'paperId': '43c719e6f18b4f8d9620829a3aa80eb89ae73559', 'title': '“As Far as They Knew I Came from France”: Stigma, Passing, and Not Speaking about the Holocaust', 'abstract': \"Today we recognize that storytelling plays an important role in helping survivors of traumatic episodes such as sexual abuse, military combat, or genocide refashion a sense of self and “work through” their traumatic experiences.

As Dubnow was being led off to his death he said 'shraibt, yiden, shraibt' ('write, Jews, write'). Dubnow wanted the genocide of European Jews, the Holocaust, to be recorded so that it could not be forgotten. Historians of modern Greece have notably failed to live up to Dubnow's injunction. Although just 1% of Greece's pre-war population, around one in six of the Greeks who died during the war was a Greek Jew. Barely 15% of Greek Jews survived. Until now there has only been one complete study of the Holocaust in Greece, Michael Molho and Joseph Nehama's In Memoriam: Hommage aux Victims Juives des Nazis en Grece (three volumes, Salonica and Buenos Aires, 1948-1953). Molho and Nehama has been updated and translated into Greek, although the best edition is the 1965 Hebrew edition Shoat Yehudei Yavan (The Holocaust of Greek Jews, Jerusalem 1965). Thanks to Michael Matsas there is finally a book in English on the Holocaust in Greece. The Illusion of Safety is a useful contribution to the literature. The book is divided into three sections: a historical account which relies heavily on Molho and Nehama, a collection of survivors' and resistance fighter's testimonies and Matsas' own personal memoir of his flight to the mountains to escape the Germans. Matsas survived by fleeing to the remote village of Psilovrahos in the mountains between Karditsa and Agrinion. Although not a professional historian, Matsas, a professional dentist, has assembled useful testimonies and material. He has undertaken some archival research in the US National Archives and has used both State Department and Organisation for Strategic Services (OSS) materials. The Illusion of Safety raises questions which professional historians have not tackled and provides materials of interest to the general reader. Matsas frequently quotes large excerpts from official documents, in contrast with the more selective use of these sources by professional historians. Matsas is refreshingly frank in discussing anti-Semitism in wartime Greece. On the basis of American archival material, Matsas argues that too many Greek Christians in Salonica were indifferent to the fate of the city's Jews. A key source is the striking and troubling cable which the American Consul General in Istanbul, Burton Berry, sent back to Washington in March 1944. Berry reported an interview with four Jewish refugees who had fled Athens in mid-December 1943. According to the refugees: '[T]he attitude of the Greek people toward the Jews was praised in the highest terms. With the exception of the Greeks of Salonica, who are reported to have had an unsympathetic and sometimes hostile attitude toward the Jews during the persecution of 1943, the Jewish refugees pay the sincerest possible tribute of respect and admiration for the Greeks who have consistently given aid, even at the cost of tremendous sacrifices.' This is an important quote from an important document. The vast majority of Greek Jews lived in Salonica, some 55,000 of the 77,000 Jews in Greece before the war, making the 'exception' of Salonica something which professional historians have to explain. Mazower is the only other historian to reference the Berry cable, but he omits the vitally important quote about the 'exception' of Salonica and\", 'year': 2000}, {'paperId': '4446c2d56a7b828bb780b7d052bec2d76f10777e', 'title': 'Protecting Our Families in the Aftermath of 9/11 and the Holocaust', 'abstract': '“Never again” is the cry relating to the Holocaust that thunders around the world.

Having achieved independence in 1919 -- after more than a hundred years of subjugation to Russia, Prussia, and Austria -- by 1939, Poland was carved up into Soviet and Nazi spheres of domination. Poles of all stripes were rounded up, deported, tortured, and killed in both totalitarian spheres, while Polish-Jews were slated for extermination by the Nazis. By the end of the war nearly three million Poles, ten percent of the population, and three million Polish Jews, ninety percent of the Jewish population, had perished.Given their common history of victimization one could imagine that Poles and Jews would recognize their common humanity, but one would be wrong. Many Polish Jews recall the pervasive pre-war antisemitism that poisoned their lives and the wartime indifference, or worse, of their fellow Poles. They also point to the pogroms that engulfed hundreds of Holocaust survivors when they tried to return to claim their homes after the war. Itzhak Shamir, the former Prime Minister of Israel, who had been born in Poland and emigrated to Palestine as a young man, once said: \"Poles have imbibed hatred of Jews with their mothers\\' milk.\" Most Polish Jews and their descendants would sadly agree.However, most Poles view the matter quite differently. They minimize pre-war antisemitism, and they blame Jewish inability to assimilate for Polish-Jewish tensions. They argue that during the war, despite the extreme danger, thousands of Poles perished hiding or defending Jews from the Nazis. And they explain that after the war, Poland was engulfed in civil war between nationalists and communists that led to thousands of casualties, both Jewish and non-Jewish.Eva Hoffman\\'s aim in Shtetl is not to sort out these claims and counter-claims, rather it is to historicize the relationship, thereby allowing for some perspective and nuance to enter into the conversation between Poles and Jews.

Exploring three large-scale collections—the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies at Yale University, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) Oral History Collection, and the University of Southern California (USC) Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History Archive—Shenker signals the need to consider “the mutual labor involved in testimony.” As he notes, “institutional practices,” from the training of interviewers to decisions about filming and subsequent dissemination practices, “constitute voices of testimonial co-authorship that act in conversation with those of interviewers and witnesses.” Adopting a broadly chronological approach, Shenker starts with the Fortunoff Archive whose roots lay in “grassroots” initiatives taken in the late 1970s. As Shenker demonstrates, the involvement of Laurence Langer in the project from 1984 was critical in shaping practice that rejected linear interviewing or placing time limits on the length of an interview, flagged a range of “inappropriate questions” that were seen as judgmental, and emphasized the agency of the interviewee over the interviewer. As project director Geoffrey Hartman explained, “we do not try to make historians of the survivors. We listen to them, try to free their memories,” and in particular the kind of “deep memory” so prized by Langer. Although the USHMM originally worked closely with the Fortunoff Archive, divisions emerged over questions of access. More importantly, USHMM’s creating of the Permanent Exhibition drove a different collecting policy that, while it initially drew on the open-ended approach of the Fortunoff Archive, became more concerned with covering the key narrative anchors of the Permanent Exhibition and generating what Martin Smith dubbed “little nuggets” and therefore adopted a list of “core questions.” While Shenker points to the importance of Langer in shaping Fortunoff, he fails to explore the role that Joan Ringelheim played at USHMM. Her interviews ran to eight or more hours, and she asked a whole new set of questions reflecting her interests in gender and the Holocaust, rather than ideas of deep and common memory that Shenker tends to privilege over historiographical concerns.', 'year': 2017}, {'paperId': '462e10d7f791f5e1cab1cad19f847216d20fad93', 'title': 'Coping Strategies of Female Holocaust Survivors', 'abstract': 'This paper describes how Holocaust survivors learned to help themselves and to reestablish their sense of community and self-worth.

In April of 2002, the Human Sciences graduate program at George Washington University, Washington, D.C., sponsored its eighth annual conference. The focus was to examine relationships among psychoanalysis, culture, and ethnography. Academic scholars from California, New York, Belgium, China, and elsewhere, gathered with many local analysts from the Washington Psychoanalytic Institute to hear keynote talks by Christiane Hartnack, Vincent Crapanzano, Paul Verhaeghe, John Kafka, and Elisabeth Young-Bruehl. We are delighted to publish some of the contributions from that conference, including papers by Daniel Rancour-Laferriere on Russian icons, jan jagodzinski on body-building, Kimberly Chabot Davis on psychoanalysis and the Birmingham tradition of audience studies, Shannon May on trauma and Chinese cinema, and Ricardo Ainslie on the repercussions of the murder of James Byrd. Ainslie and Brabeck’s piece, in which they interview residents of Jasper, Texas (where Byrd was killed) to understand what factors play into the heightening or containment of racial tensions, is also an excellent contribution to the declared special topic for this issue: the psychic and the social in clinical work. The papers we have assembled for this special section illuminate two aspects of this topic. First, there are a number of articles and notes that illustrate some of the ways that psychoanalytic understanding can be applied to social situations and group experiences. Among these are the articles by Ainslie and Brabeck and by Julie Oxenberg, about a project in which she worked with children of Nazis and children of Holocaust survivors. This aspect of the psychic and the social is also illustrated in the international notes by Linda Robinson, who writes about the Middle East and compares Sharon and Arafat’s impasse to an impasse she experienced with a couple in treatment, and by Andrew Samuels, who writes about a clinical activist group he co-founded in the UK. While all of these authors are clinicians, their focus is not on the work they do in their clinical practice but rather on how they have applied psychoanalytic thinking to larger social concerns. Susan Van Zyl’s paper, which suggests that public antagonism towards psychoanalysis has something to do with the enormous differences between the kind of speech and behavior that is expected of the patient on the couch and the kind expected of the citizen on the street, provides a bridge between the two different aspects of the relation between the psychic and the social we present here. As Andrew Samuels points out in his piece, the psychoanalytic left has been far more wont to apply psychoanalytic thinking to the social world than to interrogate the social in the clinical encounter itself. There are many implicit and explicit taboos about bringing socio-historical reality into the consulting room, and for most clinicians, the family is the largest social context they allow to surface in an individual treatment. If we take seriously some of the academic theoretical breakthroughs of the past ten or fifteen years, however, for example Judith Butler’s work on gender, Homi Bhabha’s work on race, Pierre Bourdieu’s work on class, and we look at the construction of identity as a process that in part occurs by splitting off parts of self associated with abject others, then we must at least begin to wonder how individual suffering is related to whatever individuals have split off to take their “proper” social place, even if the individuals themselves are completely unaware that their racial identity, sexual', 'year': 2003}, {'paperId': '46623ef1d870cc6308044cd7fb8d1ac9b85237d1', 'title': 'Assessment of a digital intervention program with Holocaust survivors.', 'abstract': 'OBJECTIVE\\nThis study evaluated a digital intervention program with aging Holocaust survivors.

Subject to extreme levels of coercion, these victims were compelled to act in ways that have been judged as both self-serving and harmful to fellow inmates. Such situations, which exemplify what influential theorist Lawrence Langer terms ‘choiceless choices’, are the chief concern of Primo Levi's paradigmatic essay on the ‘grey zone’. In light of these key conceptualizations of the ethical dilemmas of Holocaust victims, the paper analyses the representation of ‘privileged’ Jews in several videotestimonies recorded at the Jewish Holocaust Museum and Research Centre (JHMRC) in Melbourne, Australia. It will be shown that judgements of victims in extremis cause considerable problems for attempts to testify to the complex situations and experiences of ‘privileged’ Jews. The role of the interviewer is a crucial factor in this, particularly when interviewers are themselves Holocaust survivors. The paper reveals that while it might be argued that moral evaluations of ‘privileged’ Jews should be suspended, judgements are often imposed on Holocaust testimonies in various ways and have a significant impact on their content.\", 'year': 2010}, {'paperId': '46e59a5310553a2303e784e56083030a23e7fc71', 'title': 'Nursing Care of Elderly Holocaust Survivors.', 'abstract': 'Mit dem zunehmenden Alter der Holocaust-Uberlebenden und dem haufigeren Kontakt zwischen Uberlebenden und professioneller Pflege treten auch fur die Pflege neue Anforderungen und Schwierigkeiten auf.

He describes a lively debate that began after the group watched the taped testimony of a woman who was an eyewitness to the Auschwitz uprising in which prisoners set fire to the camp. The woman reported four chimneys going up in flames and exploding, but historians insisted that since there was only one chimney blown up, her testimony was incorrect and should be discredited in its entirety because she proved herself an unreliable witness. One historian suggested that her testimony should be discounted because she \" ascribes importance to an attempt that, historically, made no difference \" (Felman, 1992, p. 61). The psychoanalysts responded that the woman was not testifying to the number of chimneys blown up but to something more \" radical \" and more \" crucial, \" namely, the seemingly unimaginable occurrence of Jewish resistance at Auschwitz, that is to say, the historical truth of Jewish resistance at Auschwitz. Laub concludes that what the historians could not hear, listening for empirical facts, was the \" very secret of survival and of resistance to extermination \" (Felman, 1992, p. 62). The Auschwitz survivor saw something unfamiliar, Jewish resistance, which gave her the courage to resist. She saw something that in one sense did not happen — four chimneys blowing up — but in another made all the difference to what happened. Seeing the impossible — what did not happen — gave her the strength to make what seemed impossible possible, surviving the Holocaust. While the historians were listening to hear confirmation of what they already knew, the psychoanalysts where listening to hear something new, something beyond comprehension. While the historians were trying to recognize empirical facts in the survivor\\'s testimonies, the psychoanalysts were trying to acknowledge that the import of these testimonies was unrecogniza-ble. Although undeniably powerful in their impact, the empirical facts of the Holocaust are dead to the process of witnessing, that which cannot be reported by the eyewitness, the unseen in vision and the unspoken in speech, that which is beyond recognition in history, the process of witnessing itself.

Unfortunately, this benefited very few, since only some 200 native and 1000 foreign Jews lived in the country. In “Pilgrimages to the Past: Jewish Returns to Eastern and Central Europe,” Marta Bladek compares autobiographical texts by four writers describing visits to their shtetlakh after the war. Eli Wiesel and Aharon Appelfeld experienced the Holocaust at first hand as teenagers, and Eva Hoffmann at one remove as the daughter and Daniel Mendelssohn at two removes as the grandson of survivors. The sensitive analysis of the texts demonstrates how they all try to recapture life before the Holocaust but must “realize that it is impossible to reenter and repossess places from the past, which itself exists only as a memory or a conjecture” (246). “Political Tolerance and Intolerance: Using Qualitative Interviews to Understand the Attitudes of Holocaust Survivors” by Nancy Isserman asks how “the experience of surviving persecution ... influences political attitudes of tolerance and intolerance towards perpetrators of genocide” (258). She identifies three types of survivor – the “tolerant,” the “limited-tolerant” and the “intolerant” (265ff.) – and relates their reactions to a variety of factors, such as “perceived threat, worldview, the nature of the war experiences and political ideology” (284). With its impressive battery of questions and its thorough interpretation of the answers, the essay appears to be a sophisticated piece of research, but one may wonder about the statistical significance of a sample of no more than 18 individuals.

As its title indicates, Imaginary Witness traces how Hollywood has depicted the Holocaust in feature films. Daniel Anker, who won an Oscar for his documentary Scottsboro: An American Tragedy, interweaves clips from Holocaust movies, narration by Gene Hackman, and interviews with survivors who work in the film industry like Branko Lustig and Robert Clary, directors of major Holocaust pictures like Steven Spielberg and Sidney Lumet, and scholars like Michael Berenbaum and Annette Insdorf to illustrate how the portrayal of the Shoah has evolved in Hollywood productions over the past 60 years. Anker devotes much of the documentary to the formative years of Holocaust cinema. He locates the causes of Hollywood\\'s timidity to make films critical of Hitler and Nazi anti-Semitism in the assimilationist aspirations of the Jewish movie moguls, their fear of American anti-Semitism, the financial dependence of Hollywood on the German distribution market, isolationist opposition to US intervention in European affairs, and the Production Code Administration\\'s system of self-censorship. Anker gets this story essentially right, but assigns too much blame to the Jewish movie moguls because he relies so heavily on Neil Gabler\\'s characterization of the Jewish studio owners as obsessed with proving their American identity by minimizing their Jewish one. Other film historians like Michael Birdwell and Steven Can- emphasize the external pressures the Jewish producers had to contend with: the threat that Congress would regulate the film industry if it did not censor itself, the State Department which cautioned against antagonizing Germany for diplomatic and economic reasons, the Third Reich\\'s ban on movies deemed anti-German, and the PCA whose clout stemmed from grassroots backing by Catholic and Protestant organizations. Independent anti-Nazi films like Hitler\\'s Reign of Terror and Are We Civilized? were made as early as 1934, but were never released due to Germany\\'s pressure on the Loews and MGM theatre chains. Similarly, PCA chief Joseph Breen squelched MGM\\'s plans to adapt Sinclair Lewis\\'s antifascist novel It Can\\'t Happen Here into a movie in 1935. While Imaginary Witness acknowledges that Harry Warner was one of the few producers who spoke out against Hitler, it does not explore his activities in any depth. Warner Bros, discontinued its operations in Germany in 1934 to protest the order to dismiss its Jewish employees in Germany. Since shorts and cartoons fell outside the purview of the PCA, the studio made an animated cartoon Bosko\\'s Picture Show in 1933 that parodied Hitler. The 1936 Warner Bros. production Black Legion dramatized how an anti-immigrant hate group recruited a disgruntled worker who lost a promotion to a Polish co-worker. Based on a series of ethnically, racially, and religiously motivated murders by the real Black Legion, the movie\\'s script originally featured a Jew as the target of the worker\\'s wrath, but changed his identity because the PCA threatened to withhold its seal of approval if this \"inflammatory\" plot detail remained in the final cut of the film. Breen worried that the portrayal of anti-Semitism in Warner Bros.\\' The Life of Emile Zola (1937) might provide Germany with a pretext to ban all American films from distribution in the country. In response the studio limited its reference to Alfred Dreyfus\\' Jewish heritage to a single visual allusion. The busting of an American Nazi spy ring in 1938 provided the opportunity for Warner Bros.\\' to produce Confessions of a Nazi Spy. Highlighting the dangers Nazi authoritarianism and racism posed to American democracy, the movie never mentioned anti-Semitism. Anyone cognizant of current events, however, would have recognized that these movies implicitly denounced Hitler and Nazi ideology. Although Hollywood remained hesitant about tackling the issue of Nazi anti-Semitism until the United States entered the war in late 1941, Charlie Chaplin\\'s independent production of The Great Dictator (1940) mocked Hitler as an ambitious dictator with aggressive military aims and an obsessive hatred of Jews. …', 'year': 2005}, {'paperId': '48ccedabc821e509cad14a97f9989107826bd62d', 'title': 'Two boys—one event', 'abstract': 'The background of this paper is an investigation of child survivors from the Holocaust; in a study of interviews of these survivors, it could be concluded that past traumatic experiences are recovered not as memories (in the usual sense of the word), but as affects invading the present.

When it comes to survivors’ testimonies, the messenger is as important as the message. The first to subscribe to this reasoning was the American psychologist David Boder, who in 1946 set out to interview survivors in refugee camps across Western Europe. Equipped with what was then the state- of- the- art technology—an Armour Model 50 wire recorder—Boder went on to produce what was the first audio testimony of the Holocaust. The wire recorder, developed in the 1940s by Marvin Camras, Boder’s colleague at the Illinois Institute of Technology, for the U.S. military, was a portable and remarkably durable device that utilized thin steel wires rolled into spools to produce an electromagnetic recording (see Fig. 4.1 below). As Boder later commented, the device “offered a unique and exact means of recording the experiences of displaced persons. Through the wire recorder the displaced person could relate in his own language and in his own voice the story of his concentration camp life.” Studying wire- recorded narratives led him to devise a “traumatic index” by means of which “each narrative may be assessed as to the category and number of experiences bound to have a traumatizing effect upon the victim.” Boder’s 1949 monograph, I Did Not Interview the Dead, invites readers to find indications of trauma implicit in selected transcripts of recorded narratives. The premise seems to be that, to the extent that such traumatic impact exists, it should be discoverable textually. Yet the same technology that made Boder’s project ingenious was also the reason for its relative obscurity. Wire recording was soon to give way to tape recording, consequently condemning Boder’s wire spools to obsolescence and the testimonies they held to near oblivion. The short- lived medium precluded access to the recorded material.', 'year': 2019}, {'paperId': '49e985ec77e035a33fa8ff8abc751612c033c0e6', 'title': 'Fresh Wounds: Early Narratives of Holocaust Survival, Edited by Donald L.

Thus, Jews from Italy, Greece, and most Western European countries were omitted from the process. Niewyk points out the more unique features of the narratives, emphasizing their \"special value\" and noting that they were made before the survivors\\' memories were \"blurred\" by the passage of time. Boder\\'s efforts to publish his scholarship in the 1950s essentially failed because there was no market for his product. Ironically, Boder died just as Adolf Eichmann was brought to trial. Had he lived, Boder might have received proper credit for his efforts and the public would have been exposed to the entire collection of interviews.Niewyk leaves the essence of the interviews intact, allowing the reader to feel their full impact. These accounts are special because these victims had no time to analyze or to rationalize the actions of their tormentors or, in some cases, their fellow prisoners. Nor had their anger subsided. These people did not have the luxury of having fifty years to become retrospective about their experiences. They spoke without having been exposed to material that could have enhanced their stories to make them more accurate, horrific, or marketable.The material covers every imaginable Holocaust experience. Some of the information is common knowledge, and stories of starvation, harsh conditions in the camps, and the general dehumanization process are often repeated. On the other hand, a number of the survivors had witnessed some of the most significant events of the Holocaust including the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, the revolt of the Sonderkommandos at Auschwitz, and the Slovak National uprising. Some of the accounts contain small factual errors which Niewyk corrects. …', 'year': 2001}, {'paperId': '4bbc040c5cf2e350a5783f0a6b86b6e5ba98e01c', 'title': 'Rape, the Unspeakable War Crime: An Interview with Slavenka Drakulic and Juanita Wilson on the Award-Winning Filmic Rendition of as If I Am Not There', 'abstract': 'In the following interview, conducted in March 201 1 at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, acclaimed Croatian writer Slavenka Drakulic discusses the filmic adaptation of her 2001 novel with its director and scriptwriter, the Irish filmmaker Juanita Wilson. Based on several real life stories, As If I Am Not There (published in the USA under the title S: A Novel about the Balkans) deals with the mass rape of women in 1992 in Bosnia during the war. Alice Kuzniar, Professor of German and English as well as Chair in Croatian Studies at the University of Waterloo, leads the discussion on the choices the novelist and filmmaker make in their respective media when they represent atrocities committed against women. Given the unspeakable nature of war rape, Wilson and Drakulic address their commitment to having such suffering recognized by the international community. Even as fate as 1994-96 when he was the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, Justice Richard Goldstone assessed \"Rape has never been the concern of the international community,\" even though the 1949 Geneva Convention expressly prohibited wartime rape and enforced prostitution. There are two possible misperceptions behind this opinion: one, if rape is perceived as something personal and sexual, it is depoliticized. Two, women are seen as mere causalities of war, so that rapists are perceived as not having to be prosecuted in war crime tribunals. However, a 2001 verdict by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) stipulated that rape and sexual enslavement were crimes against humanity, challenging the widespread acceptance of rape and sexual enslavement of women as intrinsic part of war. ICTY found three Bosnian Serb men guilty of rape of women and girls (some as young as 12 and 15 years of age), in eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina. Furthermore two of the men were found guilty of the crime against humanity of sexual enslavement. It is estimated that between 20,000 and 50,000 women were raped in the war in Bosnia. As If! Am Not There tells the story of these events through the eyes of one woman\\'s horrific experiences.

In 1994 in Rwanda, genocide occurred and the Kigali Memorial Center of Genocide is one of the Memorials (Holocaust) which stands as a reminder of the horror, in order to inform the community to keep watching. This raised the curiosity of the researcher, to analyze how these new symbols can contribute to restore and revitalize social and cultural values in the context of Rwanda. The inside of the house offers on opportunity to visit the displayed history in which the genocide is rooted, including the period of genocide through survivors' experiences represented in short movies and by the material used in the killings. There is a room reserved for displays of the others' genocides in the world. Outside the house, mass graves surrounded by a garden, announce the burial place and a documentary place. The first chapter is the general introduction of the study and outlines the framework of the study. The second chapter offers the syntheses of the literature review that it presents the social and political context in which the genocide took root. The third chapter offers the theoretical framework which deals with the nature of culture and its influence in the understanding of the Kigali Memorial Center of Genocide. The fourth chapter focuses on the fieldwork methodology. This study makes use of the qualitative approach. The primary data was collected through in-depth interviews of twenty one individuals and discussions with four focus groups with ten respondents in each group. Respondents were randomly chosen. The secondary data was used to complete the primary data. The fifth chapter is the presentation of the research findings. The findings reveal that after completing the construction of the Kigali Memorial Center of Genocide in 2004, spontaneous and organized visits to the Kigali Memorial Center of Genocide have taken place. This 'window' of what happened, inspires visitors and communities that there is a need to understand the past which can help in building a hopeful future together, for sustainable peace.

In keeping with trauma discourse, souvenirs of deathworlds are depicted as incapable of encapsulating sublime suffering or breaching the wall of silence between survivors and descendants, failing to constitute a material legacy. Rather than act as conduits for ‘continuing bonds’ with the past and the dead, survivors are expected to disentangle the self from souvenirs of difficult pasts facilitating separation and recovery. Ethnographic interviews with descendants depict the way discursive framing elides the semiotic potential of domestic material traces of the Holocaust and parent–child–object relations engendering intimate inter-corporeality and embodied memory.

In its wake, experiencing, remembering, and imagining were severely compromised, if not abolished. In the absence of a protective parental shield, the processes of symbolization, mental representation, and narrativization came to a halt at the nadir of the extreme traumatization. A breakdown of intrapersonal and interpersonal communication ensued. Defensive processes, mobilized to address the catastrophe, were set in motion. What emerged were the “shards of memory”: composites of fragmented experience and of those defensive operations that attempted to contain them. It is through closely examining these shards of memory, this phenomenology of destruction, that we can get a better understanding of the damage that occurred, and begin to look for ways of addressing it. We can also come to see the way traumatic memory attempts to restore the lost good object, even as this memory attests to the continual destruction of that object. This study necessitates close readings of survivors’ testimonies. These close-ups highlight the prevalence of parapraxes, which demarcate communicative breakdowns. Such breakdowns occur on an intrapersonal level when affects and experiences cannot be symbolized. They also occur on an interpersonal/intersubjective level: among survivors who jointly testify to an event, and between survivors and the interviewers who listen to their testimony. To illuminate this phenomenon, we have selected moments from two video testimonies, and subjected them to close reading.

The role of the social and religious set in organizing response to the Holocaust is traced. Unique dream phenomena in this group, with brief ciinical vignettes, is provided. Often recurring clinical syndromes in the Hasidic Survivor population are discussed. A detailed case history with 'a strategic therapeutic approach is provided, and other treatment considerations are explored. The response possibilities of the system memory in traumatized individuals are outlined, and the centrality of activity-passivity conflicts in Survivors is noted. I n the autumn of 1974, following a request for assistance from a Hasidic Group in New York City, the Human Resources Administration estab- lished a Holocaust Survivor Project to provide psychological services for survivors and their children. The request for aid had come after community leaders noted an increasing occurrence of family conflicts, marital difficulties, childhood disturbances, and individual mental health crises in their people, especially among first- and second-generation survivors. As there were no trained professionals within the community concerned, an appeal was made for outside help--a step most unusual for this group, which sets a very high priority on its autonomy and privacy. The request in itself thus reflected the extent and gravity of the problem. Eventually the project was extended to serve the needs of a larger population of Orthodox and Hasidic Jews living in the city. In 1974, at the inception of the project, 762 family cases were screened and 455 families given some form of service. A trilingual questionnaire had been distributed to families in the Social Service catchment area, and a number of cases were undertaken following the response to this outreach attempt. In addition, staff members of the project, in the field at Social Service centers, had many requests for homemaking and housekeeping services from women, especially those just postpartum. In the course of interviews to attend to these requests, more cases came to light and were referred to me for discussion and consultation.\", 'year': 1980}, {'paperId': '4ddcd34842e902c641b2ec1197982f027e1ccd0d', 'title': 'Coping strategies in the narratives of Holocaust survivors', 'abstract': 'Abstract Although the memories of Holocaust survivors have been explored in a vast number of autobiographical, biographical, and clinical publications, there has been very little application of nomothetic as opposed to idiographic methodology in this area.

Refugee populations are such groups, calling for various theoretical and methodological considerations during the process of conceptualization, operationalization, sampling, and data collection. The demographics of refugees have dramatically changed since the breakdown of the former Soviet Union in the late 1980s and the war in the former Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. More than 50 percent of the refugees who came to the U.S. since that time are Eastern Europeans (U.S. Department of Justice, 1999). While many challenges can be clustered under crosscultural issues, considering the diversity of these refugees in the U.S., researchers need to address specific difficulties with surveying refugees and solutions for these difficulties. Further, communitybased research on refugees requires special attention to ethical issues, which are beyond a scope of the federal regulations on research ethics. Pernice (1994) argued some methodological difficulties of studying mental health issues of refugees, challenging the universal applicability of conventional research methods used by psychologists. Her research was primarily with Indochinese refugees and Pacific Island immigrants to New Zealand. In this paper, we specify several difficulties with surveying refugees based upon our own research on refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina in St. Louis, Missouri. Difficulties with Surveying Refugees and Solutions There are five major difficulties with surveying refugees. Conceptualization of the research topic: Researchers conduct an extensive literature review on a relevant research topic for the purpose of conceptualization and subsequent hypothesis development. There are cases in which very few references relevant to the research topic or the target population exist. This was the case of the study with Bosnian refugees. Most of the research on Bosnian refugees is related to political and mental health issues. Although there existed a large number of studies on Cuban refugees and Vietnamese refugees who came to the U.S. in the 1960’s and 1970’s respectively, a question arose whether or not some of these findings are applicable to Bosnian refugees who entered the U.S. in the 1990’s. Bosnians’ religious background as Muslims and racial background as Caucasians also made them very distinct in comparison with Cubans and Vietnamese who were racial minorities. Due to the lack of extensive literature available for conceptualization and the ethnic characteristics different from previous refugees, the authors used a ‘sequential exploratory method’ with a grounded theory method. We specified several concepts which are assumed to explain Bosnians’ resettlement processes, based upon qualitative data which were obtained from face-toface interview with Bosnian refugees, service providers at refugee resettlement agencies, and state and federal officials. Two major concepts emerged from data analysis: Comfort (finding an emotional niche) and Competence (finding a material niche). Bosnians in St. Louis are very resilient, and demonstrate a “sense of coherence,” a term coined by Aaron Antonovsky (1979), who studied Holocaust survivors in the U.S. A sense of coherence is different from coping skills in that negative experiences during one’s life course lead to a stronger will to survive. In other words, “what does not kill me makes me stronger.” Refugees undergo the process of redefinition of their identity and community development as most immigrants do, but their redefinition process differs from that of immigrants because of the refugees’ forced migration to a host country (Lam and Lanphier 2002; Warner 1993). Sense of Coherence is one of the contributing factors to refugees’ successful integration into a host country, community development, and identity reconstruction, impacting their overall satisfaction with being in America even though it was not their choice. However, this emotional niche is also impacted by the refugees’ material satisfaction, especially in the area of securing jobs and consequent occupational status. It was inevitable for refugees who held prestigious jobs in Bosnia to experience occupational demotion because of a lack of English competency and licensing problems. Furthermore, Locus of Control, Spiritual Healing, Social Support, and Experience of Discrimination are also important intervening factors which have impact on Comfort that refugees experience during the process of adaptation to American society. While Locus of Control serves as a buffer between the traumatic experiences in the war and displacement and the life satisfaction in a host country, Spiritual Healing and Social Support contribute to reducing sources of stress, having a positive impact on Comfort.', 'year': 2006}, {'paperId': '4e2bf10e21d8444c8bc7c302d092da4c50226cdb', 'title': 'Oral history off the record : toward an ethnography of practice', 'abstract': 'Foreword Steven High Introduction: Toward an Ethnography of Practice Anna Sheftel and Stacey Zembrzycki PART I: REFLECTIONS ON A LIFETIME OF LISTENING Section Introduction: Henry Greenspan 1.

Moreover, research has demonstrated that engaging in planful problem-solving activities is associated with reduced distress. Accordingly, we aimed to examine the link between engaging in activities during COVID-19 and psychological distress among Holocaust survivors with varying levels of post-traumatic symptoms (PTS) and comparisons (not directly exposed to the Holocaust). Design: A cross-sectional design composed of Holocaust survivors and a comparison group. Setting: Participants were interviewed face-to-face, over the telephone, or filled the scales online at their leisure. Participants: Data were collected from 131 older Jewish Israelis (age range 76–94, M = 82.73, SD = 4.09), who were divided into three groups (comparisons; low-PTS survivors; high-PTS survivors). Measurements: Participants completed scales assessing PTS, activity engagement, and psychological distress and provided additional sociodemographic, medical, and COVID-19-related information. Results: When activity engagement was low, high-PTS survivors reported extremely high levels of psychological distress relative to low-PTS survivors and comparisons. However, when activity engagement was high, these group differences were considerably reduced, as the psychological distress of high-PTS survivors was significantly lower. Conclusions: The study highlights the importance of daily planning and activity engagement for Holocaust survivors with high PTS levels in reducing psychological distress.

David P. Boder's 1946 Interviews of Holocaust Survivors\", 'abstract': 'In the summer of 1946, psychology professor David P. Boder (1886-1961) of the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) visited various displaced persons\\' camps in Western Europe to record the testimonies of Jews who had survived the Holocaust. For this purpose he brought along a wire recorder, a relatively-new invention of IIT\\'s Armour Research Foundation. Over the course of the summer, Boder fulfilled his mission, interviewing over 120 survivors and nearly exhausting his supply of wire spools. Back in the U.S., Boder spent most of his remaining fifteen years translating and transcribing these interviews, for as wide a dissemination as he could manage given the resources and technologies available in that era. Those are the simple facts--or, rather, the simplest facts one can posit about a story that began in complexity and which will continue to challenge humanity in its eternal quest to capture and communicate truth through the varied disciples of documentation and history. Certainly, the historical factuality of the Holocaust is accepted by the vast majority of those today who possess enough intellect, information, open-mindedness, and empathy. Unfortunately, there are also those who dispute the basic facts of this calamity--and, given that fact, the process of education cannot rest. In the late 1990s, IIT\\'s Galvin Library created the first version of its \"Voices of the Holocaust\" web site, which provided Boder\\'s English translations as well as audio clips from the minority of interviews that had been conducted in English. Such an initial effort, though limited, was a worthy endeavor. Participating staff members were called upon to re-type Boder\\'s 1950s transcripts for web use and many were profoundly moved by what they read. Then, in December 2005, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad labeled the Holocaust a \"myth.\" IIT Dean of Libraries Christopher Stewart then committed personnel and financial resources so that the remaining audio files could be posted to the site, along with transcriptions and translations that Boder had not been able to complete during his life. The vastly-improved and augmented website went live at the end of 2009. Given my \"two hats\" (an archival career coupled with a PhD. in modern European history) I was privileged to be a member of the core team that laid the groundwork for the new website in 2007-2009. However, my exceptionally-gifted colleague, Eben English, Galvin Library\\'s then-Digital Services Librarian, logged many more hours on the project than I while supervising a battery of students and translators both on-site and remotely (some as far removed as Germany). [FIGURE 1 OMITTED] In the process of preparing the new website, I of course learned more about the Holocaust and Boder\\'s career--and also about the changing usages of audio-recorded interviews since the 1940s. Those evolving usages have been determined by 1) changing goals and methodologies both in the media and in the social sciences; and, 2) by the changing technologies that have been available to those disciplines. In the remainder of this essay I will cover key elements of the larger narrative (the Holocaust and Boder\\'s role in documenting it) but will also offer some thoughts and observations on the evolution of what is now commonly known as audio-recorded \"oral history.\" The Man Who Sat Behind the Microphone It is important to know something about the man who sat behind the microphone: David P. Boder. Born in Lithuania in 1886 (when still a part of the Russian Empire), Boder was born Aron Mendel Michelsen in Libau (now Liepaja, Latvia), where his father worked in the Russian civil service. Right from birth, Boder straddled different worlds. Being Jewish in a deeply anti-Semitic empire presented the greatest potential challenge. But other cultural forces swirled around him as well. Russian was spoken in the classroom, but Boder\\'s community normally used Yiddish or German. …', 'year': 2014}, {'paperId': '50199880c23ac438c04c952947b532be95befa59', 'title': 'Domestic Listening Across Generations: Irene Oore’s The Listener: In the Shadow of the Holocaust', 'abstract': \"ABSTRACT In the last decade, critical interest in the effects of institutional and technical protocols on recorded Holocaust testimony has grown. The role of professional or volunteer adult interviewers has been re-examined, particularly in relation to taped, archival testimony, and studies demonstrate that survivor testimony is shaped by the interview situation and listening practices. However, the role of the child listener in a domestic setting in relation to postmemory autobiography and memoir has received less attention. In the analysis that follows, I focus on Irene Oore’s 2019 memoir, The Listener: In the Shadow of the Holocaust, because, as the title suggests, Oore thematizes the question of listening, asking what it means to listen to a survivor parent. My analysis considers domestic listening in relation to Holocaust testimony as well as to listening as emotion work. Oore’s text posits life writing as the most desirable outcome of domestic listening, for it can be an act of care which elicits the retelling of witness accounts. In publishing her mother’s stories, as well as her own experiences of listening to them, Oore's postmemory writing functions as deferred and mediated testimony which her mother never publicly gave.\", 'year': 2021}, {'paperId': '509bd744789162611da0e29a61673a41060333f4', 'title': 'Jewish Resistance During the Holocaust: Moral Uses of Violence and Will (review)', 'abstract': \"Jewish Resistance During the Holocaust: Moral Uses of Violence and Will, by James M. Glass. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004. 206 pp. $40.00. Usually, when one is contacted about reviewing a new book, it is a fairly straight-forward process: one decides if the topic falls within one's competence, and then one decides whether or not to accept the editor's invitation to write the review. Having written on prisoners of war during the Second World War, and having taught lectures and seminars on Hitler, Stalin, the Second World War, and the Holocaust, the reviewer felt no compunction about agreeing to examine James M. Glass's Jewish Resistance During the Holocaust: Moral Uses of Violence and Will. And yet, it was far from an easy process to evaluate Professor Glass's work. Part of the problem comes from the fact that this book cannot easily be categorized as falling within a single discipline: it raises questions and deals with topics of politics, history, psychology, sociology, philosophy, and theology. The reviewer, shamefully, has a difficult enough time speaking to colleagues within his department, let alone across the departmental divides within a campus. Reviewing this book may go some way toward rectifying this tendency. James M. Glass is Professor of Politics at the University of Maryland, College Park. He has, as the publisher informs the reader, a distinguished career as both a scholar (in terms of publications) and teacher, and has much experience in navigating between emotional, psychological, and political topics-in the last decade, with reference to the Holocaust. The book originated as a series of lectures and conference papers, which were subsequently reworked. It is based primarily upon previously published secondary literature, but is supplemented with vivid personal testimony from survivors, obtained through interviews conducted by the author, as well as surviving diaries and memoirs. Glass successfully avoids the pitfalls that often come from cobbling together sections prepared originally for other purposes: the work is thematically coherent and compelling.

It argues that these works are visual narratives that hold important empirical data about social conditions and structures during the Third Reich. These narratives, whether developed in prisons, camps, or ghettos, or in the aftermath of National Socialism, are key to understanding the victims' perspectives. Many works disclose intimate aspects of daily life that only victims saw and experienced. Thus, this artwork is an extremely valuable source for understanding prisoners' lives during the Third Reich. The article focuses on four examples: Karl Schwesig's prewar experiences illustrated in a series of prints that tell about his torture and the torture of other German Communists in a Düsseldorf jail; Malvina Schalekova's 1942–1944 drawings and paintings that expose daily life in the Terezin Ghetto; Fredrick Terna's postwar recollections about the camp at Dachau near the end of World War II; and Yehuda Bacon's 1945 retrospective of Auschwitz.\", 'year': 2023}, {'paperId': '52ed23544a9bd251995d8c51fdc7dd49ceb6a142', 'title': 'In the Shadow of the Holocaust: Nazi Persecution of Jewish-Christian Germans', 'abstract': 'The \"Halbjuden\" of Hitler\\'s Germany were half Christian and half Jewish, but, like the rest of the \"Mischlinge\" (or \"partial-Jews\"), were far too Jewish in the eyes of the Nazis. Thus, while they were allowed for a time to coexist with the rest of German society, they were granted only the most marginal or menial jobs, restricted from marrying Aryans or even leading normal social lives, and sent eventually to forced-labour and concentration camps. More than 70,000 Germans were subjected to these restrictions and indignities, created and fostered by Hitler\\'s morally bankrupt race laws, yet few personal accounts of their experiences exist. In this title, James Tent recounts how these men and women from all over Germany and from all walks of life struggled to survive in an increasingly hostile society, even as their Jewish relatives were disappearing into the East. He draws on extensive interviews with 20 survivors, many of whom were teenagers when Hitler came to power, to show how \"half Jews\" coped with conditions on a day-to-day basis and how the legacy of the hatred they suffered has forever lingered in their minds. Tent provides stories of life beneath the boot-heel of Nazi rule: a woman deemed unsuitable for a career in nursing because the shape of her earlobes and breasts indicated she was not \"racially suited\", a man arrested for \"race defilement\" because he lived with an Aryan woman, and many others. He shows how Nazi discrimination and persecution affected their lives and how such treatment intensified through the later years of the war. Tent\\'s witnesses share experiences in school and problems in the workplace, where the best survival strategy was to find an unobtrusive niche in a nondescript job. They tell of obstacles to personal relationships and they soberly remind us that by 1944 they too were rounded up for forced labour, certain to be the next victims of Nazi genocide. This text demonstrates the lengths to which the Nazis were willing to go in order to eradicate Judaism - a fanaticism that increased over time and even in the face of impending military defeat. The \"Halbjuden\" mostly survived the Holocaust, yet they paid for their re-assimilation into German society by remaining silent in the face of haunting memories. This book breaks that silence and is a testament to human endurance under the most trying circumstances.', 'year': 2003}, {'paperId': '53d61b0a228cfbde2167bf91719f4b8cc2423f70', 'title': \"The Myth of Hitler's Pope (review)\", 'abstract': 'The Myth of Hitler\\'s Pope. By Rabbi David G. Dalin. (Washington, D.C.: Regnery Publishing Co. 2005. Pp. ix, 209. $27.95.) This book had its genesis in an article by Rabbi Dalin in the Weekly Standard of February 26, 2001, entitled \"Pius XII and the Jews.\" There Dalin showed that as Nuncio in Germany in the 1920\\'s, as Papal Secretary of State from 1930, and as Pope from 1939, Eugenio Pacelli was a consistent and outspoken opponent of the Nazis.\"People at the time,\" Dalin wrote,\"Nazis and Jews alike, understood the pope to be the world\\'s most prominent opponent of the Nazi ideology.\" Hitler\\'s propaganda machine branded him \"the Jew-loving cardinal.\" During World War II Pius XII inspired and directed rescue efforts which saved hundreds of thousands of Jews from destruction. For this he received many expressions of thanks from the survivors, both during the war and thereafter. With few exceptions, Dalin charged, those who today criticize Pius XII for silence and inaction in the face of the Holocaust are angry or lapsed Catholics seeking to discredit papal authority. Their polemic would have shocked Jews of an earlier generation. By overlooking contemporary Jewish tributes to the pontiff, his present-day critics are hijacking the Holocaust in the interest of an innerCatholic debate. Jews, whatever their view of the Catholic Church, have a duty to condemn those who disparage the testimony of Holocaust survivors, especially when it transfers to others the condemnation that belongs properly to Hitler and the Nazis. Pius XII deserves not condemnation, Dalin concluded, but inclusion in Yad Vashem\\'s still lengthening list of \"righteous gentiles.\" The Myth of Hitler\\'s Pope expands this argument with additional supporting evidence. Like the works of the pope\\'s critics, it is not really history but advocacy. This is a lawyer\\'s brief for the defense, and it is brilliantly argued. For the pope\\'s critics it is devastating. Dalin bolsters his case by a chapter on \"Hitler\\'s Mufti,\" an Arab cleric who publicly supported Hitler\\'s program of Jewish extermination, both during the war in Berlin and thereafter in the Middle East. Hajj Amin al-Husseini, a virulent and active anti-Semite born in Jerusalem in 1893, was appointed Grand Mufti of Jerusalem by the British in 1922. The instigator of numerous terrorist attacks on Jews before and after the creation of the state of Israel, Husseini died in exile in 1974. Among his disciples were the Egyptian dictator Gamal Abdul Nasser and Yasser Arafat, who in an interview as late as August, 2002, called Husseini \"our hero.\" Dalin asks why Pius XII\\'s critics are so silent about the virulent hatred of Jews in the Arab world today. \"It is particularly irresponsible and outrageous,\" Dalin writes, for these critics \"to blame the Catholic Church for anti-Semitism, to falsify the Church\\'s efforts to save Jews during the Holocaust, and to ignore the fact that popes since the twelfth century have rejected the blood libel [that Jews use the blood of Christian children for ritual purposes]. …', 'year': 2005}, {'paperId': '53df4b9f76f3d2b1c067b1402c046bb19af996ec', 'title': 'Interpretation of the Unimaginable: The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, Washington, D.C., and “Dark Tourism”', 'abstract': 'The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., has received visitation levels in excess of 2 million per annum since its opening in April 1993.

Using descriptive phenomenological analysis, we examine the similarities and differences between the two groups. Group differences were found in the meaning of traumatic memory, the communication of somatoform symptoms in the Sudanese-refugee group only, conceptions of self after the traumatic event and the relationship change with the social world. Similarities included the persistence of traumatic memory, an impact on identity, a change in one’s relationship with the social world and the emergence of existential anxiety. The findings contribute to uncovering delineation points between cultural models for understanding trauma, while simultaneously presenting a potential cross-cultural language useful for understanding trauma.', 'year': 2020}, {'paperId': '551389e83aebdd4c907dc2cc32486b9d4ea8aad9', 'title': 'Room for a view: Unconscious melancholy', 'abstract': \"My daughter claims I have always been sad. In fact, she says she has inherited my unconscious melancholy. I don't think I am a morbid person. I feel content with my life — with my marriage of 40 years, my three wonderful children, my home in a part of the world where others save their pennies to visit for two weeks out of the year. Even the loss of my work as a result of cancer has brought some positive things. Yet I know what my daughter means. I do carry about some deep, mysterious sadness and have done so all my life. \\n \\nI was not always aware of it. Had my daughter made her comments 15 years ago, I would have disagreed with her. Around that time we were visiting some Jewish friends. They were upset with me for not teaching my children more about our Jewish heritage. I told them that my own childhood was lacking in Jewish religious education and that I wanted my children to make their own decisions about spiritual values. If they were interested in Judaism they could explore it themselves. Our hosts became quite angry, and at one point the husband raised his voice and called me a “Holocaust survivor.” That ended the discussion. I thought his comment was bizarre, but I always remembered it just the same. \\n \\nA few years later, I participated in a workshop sponsored by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross. The seminar dealt with issues of death and dying as well as other kinds of loss, such as divorce and abuse. For reasons I do not recall, I started to explore my feelings around being a Jew, an exercise that culminated with me screaming “I am a Jew” at the top of my lungs for several minutes. I never hid the fact of my Jewishness, but I didn't advertise it either. \\n \\nMy last name is originally German and I seemed to pass as a Gentile. When I entered medical school I received invitations from medical fraternities to join their ranks. During “rush week” I quickly noticed that none of the other applicants were Jewish. (As a Jew you learn to recognize other “landsmen.”) I was asked to join one of the fraternities, but when I asked them if they had any restrictive policies about Jewish members, the embarrassed reply was Yes. It then became apparent that only non-Jews were invited to rush week, but because no one knew me, and my last name gave no clue, I was inadvertently asked to participate. The good news is that a second fraternity chose to change their charter and welcomed me as their first Jewish brother. \\n \\nMy only formal Jewish education was at an ultra-Reform temple in Chicago. We jokingly called it St. Sinai on the Lake. I attended Sunday school, and at age 13 I was confirmed, rather than bar mitzvahed as my older brothers had been. I never learned Hebrew or travelled to Israel. My future attendance at temple was on ceremonial occasions only. \\n \\nI have a not-so-latent obsession with the Holocaust and the Second World War. My family laughs when I go out to rent a video; they want to know what Holocaust film I will return with. I read books, fiction and non-fiction, on Holocaust themes. I especially enjoy those that describe personal journeys involving dangerous escapes or heroic deeds. Sometimes I just want to read about life in the shtetl or ghetto. And, to be honest, the acts of horror also captivate my attention. But the Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC, is the closest I've been to the physical reality of the war. \\n \\nWhy this morbid fascination and curiosity? Where does my sadness originate? My immediate family escaped the Holocaust in Germany, first by moving to Europe, and ultimately by emigrating to Chicago in 1938. I was born two years later — an “accident.” After I was born my mother, then in her 40s, was hospitalized briefly for depression. Was it an accident that I was conceived around the time my paternal grandmother was murdered in Theriesenstadt? Was I unconsciously brought into this world to replace lost souls? \\n \\nMy parents never discussed their pain at leaving Europe. My father, a physician, left an important university appointment in 1933, the day after Hitler became Reich chancellor. How did it feel to say goodbye to family for the last time? How did it feel to survive when so many perished? My father's sister died in the Warsaw Ghetto. I was told some facts. I was shown some photos in an album. Feelings and emotions were never expressed. We spoke German at home. \\n \\nI have a video of my aunt talking to an interviewer about her life before leaving Germany. She described her work in the underground, and Kristallnacht, and the death of those close to her. But she turns off her emotional reactions as soon as they begin to surface and, instead, focuses on an intellectual discussion of events. \\n \\nWhen I was 11 years old my parents took me to Europe for a summer holiday. It seems remarkable to me now that we went to Germany and Austria as tourists in 1951, only six years after the war. The railway stations were still mostly rubble from the Allied bombs. Later I learned that my father went to Frankfurt to claim financial compensation from the German government. I even received a few hundred dollars every month I was in university, as part of the reparation agreement. \\n \\nLater I went on to specialize in psychiatry. Another accident? As part of my training I spent a lot of time examining my life and my family interactions. I saw in myself a tendency to deny my emotions and to intellectualize. I worked hard to reverse this trend. This period coincided with the hippie era, and so drugs also assisted me in my quest for emotional and spiritual answers. I learned a lot, but until my daughter mentioned it, I never really recognized my sadness. \\n \\nNow I understand this sadness as inherited, almost archetypal. It has roots in Judaism and branches in my immediate family of origin. Some of the flowers are in my family, and the seeds are dispersing to grow in the future. The difference now is awareness. Sadness is not the problem. Denial is. \\n \\nMy daughter, a filmmaker, has plans to make a documentary exploring our relationship and our mutual experience of sadness. The idea occurred to her when I talked about visiting Germany and seeing the birthplace of my parents. I plan to go back to Germany, to visit a concentration camp, and to see the old house belonging to our family, which has recently been relocated to a museum, to be restored as an example of German–Jewish heritage. My daughter wants to travel with me and, perhaps, to witness the healing of some wounds. The thought of this common adventure fills me with happiness. I want to see how the film ends.\", 'year': 2001}, {'paperId': '5538317cd203a05309e509a2d7aecb522dc65f5d', 'title': 'Archiv der Erinnerung: Interviews mit Überlebenden der Shoah (The Archive of Memory: Interviews with Shoah Survivors)', 'abstract': \"This interdisciplinary volume presented a pioneering study on the emerging body of Holocaust videotestimony in 1990s Germany.

The scholarly literature on descendants of Nazis reflects a group unlikely to warrant empathy or support from others because of the stigma surrounding their family's possible involvement in the Holocaust atrocities. This article uses, as a case study approach, the testimony given by Monika Hertwig, the adult daughter of a high ranking Nazi, who appears in the documentary film, Inheritance. From the perspective of disenfranchised grief, defined as grief that is not socially recognized or supported, the article links Monika's testimony with existing research from in-depth interviews with other descendants of Nazis to suggest that, as a group, they lacked permission to grieve their deceased parents, acknowledgment of their grief, and opportunities to mourn. Based on the theory that the effects of grief can be trans-generational, the disenfranchisement experienced by the “children of the Third Reich” does not have to pass to subsequent generations if opportunities for mourning are made possible and some resolution of grief occurs. Studies have shown that ongoing dialogue groups between Holocaust survivors and descendants of Nazis provide opportunities for mourning to both groups.\", 'year': 2010}, {'paperId': '5695c3f70627a5089f3688f3facfcabe3a32bbb0', 'title': 'Gendered Testimonies of the Holocaust Writing Life by Petra M.

The authors pose different research questions, use distinct methodologies to collect empirical evidence, write about specific demographic groups (Zeltser studies the Red Army personnel, for example), and offer commentary on a range of issues. Anna Shternshis\\'s essay, because of its methodology, is among the last of its kind. Soon there will be no more Holocaust survivors for scholars to interview. The author managed to speak with some 200 Jews who were Soviet citizens before 1939 and were evacuated from their place of residence in the western USSR into the Soviet interior. Technically, since they never came into contact with the Nazis, they should not be considered Holocaust survivors, but the matter has not been sorted out in the historical literature. Polish Jews deported into the Soviet interior in 1939-41--victims of Soviet repression to which they inadvertently owed their lives, and numerically the largest group of Polish Jews to survive the war--are \"automatically\" included among Holocaust survivors. They were allowed to return to their country after liberation and then, already after the war, massively fled from life-threatening Polish antisemitism to displaced persons (DP) camps in the American occupation zone in Germany. Only in 2007 did Attina Grossman begin to puzzle over why their status was not problematized in the literature. (1) Their recollections--including what they learned during the stopover in Poland about their families\\' deaths under Nazi occupation--are abundant in the archives of Holocaust testimonies, both in the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw and in Yad Vashem. In Shternshis\\'s article a single pre-Holocaust finding ominously stands out. When queried about what motivated their evacuation decision before the Nazis\\' arrival her respondents quoted fear of neighbors--of pogroms, in other words--as the most important factor that induced them to flee. Memory of the German occupation from the time of World War I, which lingered among local residents, was benign. And since Soviet propaganda muted criticism of anything untoward that the Third Reich did after the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact, there was no information about anti-Jewish Nazi policies in occupied Poland. People did, however, remember well the wave of pogroms that swept the area in the aftermath of the October Revolution and during the Civil War. With the prospect of collapse of the Soviet state authority as the front was rapidly approaching, many Jews fled, mindful of their neighbors\\' aggression a generation earlier. The study by Vladimir Solonari is grounded in the most promising sources of all those drawn upon in these essays. The historiographical breakthrough in Holocaust studies that we have observed in Poland in the last decade came through the systematic exploration of court files produced, for the most part, in the late 1940s when people were brought to justice for alleged wartime collaboration with the Germans. Solonari\\'s essay demonstrates that similar materials--postwar trials and investigations--provide rich details about the mechanism of, and personnel involved in, killings of Jews in southern Ukraine. His study is limited to the area occupied by the Romanians, but there is no reason, it seems to me, why a similar quality of evidence could not be culled from the Soviet-era secret police archives about other regions of Ukraine and Belorussia. Anika Walke\\'s article about Jewish youth in the Minsk ghetto makes in passing an interesting point that Soviet Jews were the most impoverished (542-43). They had no personal property to speak of, which in itself adversely affected their chances of survival in hiding compared to Jews from \"capitalist\" Eastern Europe. Among young Jewish boys raised in the Soviet Union, however, only \"some of them were circumcised\" (551), which gave them as a cohort more survival chances outside the ghetto. …', 'year': 2014}, {'paperId': '5b2c756cd3e75f4e3792c7f29e2e081111830c4e', 'title': 'Revisionen', 'abstract': 'Abstract Referring to the video testimony of Holocaust survivor Mrs. K. and interviewer and psychoanalyst Kurt Grünberg, I propose to analyse the body movement behavior in interaction in this interview as the “Gestalt” of memory units.

The study sample was composed of 356 Amharic-speaking Ethiopians from Ethiopia and Israel, aged 18—55, divided into three groups: i) general population; ii) people in non-psychiatric treatment; iii) people in psychiatric treatment. They were interviewed with the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ), modified to include 10 culturally specific items, and the Brief Psychiatric Research Scale (BPRS) as a criterion of psychopathology. Physicians also completed an encounter form about the presence of mental health symptoms in participants. To make the questions more culturespecific, the translation of 12 items on the SRQ was changed. The content, construct, and criterion validity of each question were also examined, leading to the deletion of five items. The validity of the revised instrument (SRQ-F) was superior to that of the original instrument (SRQ). This study demonstrates the need for psychiatric screening instruments to be adapted to different cultures by incorporating meaningful translations and adding culturally specific items.', 'year': 2009}, {'paperId': '5deca084024eaa3ae9de1cf645f1091a893c9fe7', 'title': \"Fred Zinnemann's Search (1945-48): Reconstructing the voices of Europe's children\", 'abstract': 'In the years immediately following World War II, American filmmakers contemplating foreign locations encountered massive logistical problems and ideological resistance from studio bosses.

Her study deals with the results of group encounters between children of Holocaust survivors and children of Nazi perpetrators she supervised over a ten-year period. The volume carries a slightly deceptive title, as the word justice is used in the context of post-Holocaust dialogue between these second generation groups. In this respect, justice means a process for dialogue and coming to terms with the past, which has resulted in many misconceptions by each side about the other, rather than issues connected with financial restitution. The author\\'s interest in the subject came from her own background as a child of Holocaust survivors, plus some of the disquieting conclusions drawn by Hannah Arendt from the trial of Adolf Eichmann about \"the banality of evil\" and the accusations of Jewish complicity through the Jewish councils (Judenrate). Weissmark also uses Stanley Milgram\\'s well-known electrical shock experiment that focused on obedience to authority as a source for understanding the relationship between German antisemitism and the issue of how obedience played a role in the extermination of the Jews. Weissmark confesses that conclusions by both Arendt and Milgram established taboos about investigating attitudes among the second generations: Jewish actions that helped the Nazis might reduce the uniqueness of the Holocaust and implicate Jews in their own destruction, while Milgram\\'s experiment might suggest that following orders rather than hatred was the dominant motive for German actions. All of this might be a rehashing of well-known historical issues if the author had not asked the question of how the above issues were passed to subsequent generations on both sides. In this book, the bulk of the interesting and new material comes directly from clinical sessions between the two second-generation groups that met together. It is in this context that the issue of justice becomes intergenerational. The key answer which the author as psychologist seems to search for is how both children of survivors and children of Nazis have perceived both injustice and justice in their parents\\' experiences. The study ultimately was based on interviewing eleven children of Holocaust survivors and eleven children of Nazi perpetrators. The survey and interview project seems to have revealed some interesting conclusions. First was \"ethnic identification,\" meaning that both sides shared an identity that was rooted in the war experiences of the parents. Secondly, \"double victimization\" was identified as children of each victim group repeated the experiences of their parents as essential elements in their lives. The third issue was \"feelings of indignation\" that each side felt relating to the nature of the crime and justice or the nature of the guilt inflicted on the German side in the aftermath of the war. Weissmark indicates that institutionalization of resentment in the post-war era through reparations seems to have satisfied neither side. Survivors have felt short-changed and disturbed because of the massive alterations and trauma in their lives, while Germans had to deal with issues of collective guilt. The author notes that \"[t]he program failed to remedy feelings of hatred and resentment; in fact, it perpetuated such feelings\" (p. 69). It is the conclusion about the failure of immediate post-war justice programs that led the author to conclude that redressing the injustices can only be solved through dialogue. The dialogue she refers to involves the next generation, to whom the guilt and sense of indignity was transferred. So, process here is perhaps as important as results, in that discussion in Weissmark\\'s group led to each side facing the other, often for the first time, in an open setting. The result was complex, but one conclusion was that both groups felt themselves as victims of the past and that attitudes handed down from parents about this past were impediments to independent thinking about the subject. …', 'year': 2005}, {'paperId': '5f679b9a0678fa2b982caea0d76e8c83bfd05e2a', 'title': 'THE VICTIM AS HELPER-PROSOCIAL BEHAVIOR DURING THE HOLOCAUST*', 'abstract': 'The focus of this paper is on the incidence and nature of help received and provided by victims during the Holocaust.

To date, there have been approximately 100,000 recorded interviews of Holocaust survivors. The vast majority of these interviews—such as the 52,000 done for Steven Spielberg’s and USC Shoah Foundation Archive—have used traditional, single-session, and “neutral” methods of oral history interviewing to “capture” and “preserve” the legalistic, historical “testimonies” of survivors.

I do this in order to see those I work with as experiential authorities able to help me address the classic and post-modern issues of human meaning, connection, and value in the postHolocaust world.

Such firepower has profound and troubling implications for insects namely, has escalation in the arms race produced enough atomic weaponry that if a nuclear war were to break out, a cockroach maybe couldn’t survive? It’s one of those entomological truisms, a fact that everyone who knows nothing else about insects can recite, that “If there’s a nuclear war, cockroaches will be the only survivors.” Cultural references to the radiationresistance and durability of cockroaches abound. According to an interview with band member Coby Dick, the metal/punk group Papa Roach picked the name because “a cockroach can survive anything: earthquake, nuclear holocaust. They come in small numbers, and then they infest. We want to infest the world” (S. Quelland 1999, http:// www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/ 10.07.99/paparoach-9940.html). When officials in New Zealand wanted to alert the public about Y2K preparedness, they chose as their symbol a cockroach because its ability to survive any kind of disaster, including a nuclear one, is so well known (http:// www.jsonline.com/news/intl/ap/jul99/apnew-zealand-mil072299.asp). There’s even a website advertising a “giant deluxe cockroach,” a five-inch rubber roach, “which like most cockroaches could probably survive a nuclear war” (http://www.insectarium.com/ NewCatalog/toys/09525.htm). So, people can take comfort in the thought that the fortunate few human survivors of a nuclear Armageddon can play post-Apocalyptic practical jokes on one another. It’s not easy to figure out where this idea of cockroach radiation resilience originated. It doesn’t seem to have been the result of an empirical test. Atomic bomb blasts have been (mercifully) few and far between and, after an exhaustive search, I couldn’t find any obvious references to postblast investigators noting the presence of unperturbed roaches at ground zero. There are, though, dozens of references on the Internet and elsewhere to the solitary gingko tree that apparently remained standing after the bomb blast in Hiroshima; vendors of herbal medicines unfailingly mention that fact when touting the virtues of gingko in maintaining mental acuity, preventing asthma attacks, speeding poststroke recovery, and increasing blood flow to the penis (e.g., http://www. nutraceutical.com/educate/pdf/gingko.pdf). So, most likely, the idea that cockroaches would be the sole survivors of a nuclear holocaust must have come from laboratory studies on radiation resistance. But what laboratory data exist aren’t exactly consistent with cockroach supremacy. Among other things, cockroaches are relative newcomers to the ranks of the radiation-resistant. Probably the first study done to determine the effects of radiation on insects dates back to 1919 when W. P. Davey tested the effects of small doses of X-rays on the longevity of Tribolium confusum; surprisingly, Davey found that chronic exposure to Xrays at a dose of about 60 rads actually prolonged the life of this flour beetle. This finding evidently languished in the literature for about 37 years until a dubious J. M. Cork (1957) repeated the study under more controlled conditions and to his dismay obtained essentially the same result (concluding his paper with the remark, “It is hoped that the results reported on a simple structure of this kind will not be construed as a license for X-ray practitioners to become less critical of recognized safety factors in dealing with the human organism”). Perhaps the most widely cited study documenting effects of radiation on insects was H. J. Muller’s (1927) demonstration of artificial transmutation of genes in Drosophila melanogaster; Muller essentially was the first person to induce mutations, an accomplishment that revolutionized the science of genetics. Hanson and Heys (1928) heralded the accomplishment as “one of the most notable events in the field of pure biology in this century” and extolled the virtues of the new mutagenic agent; “on one Sunday afternoon, 40 mutations were found. Prior to the use of the X-ray, if one mutation were found in 40 Sunday afternoons the time would have been considered well spent.” Exposure to X-rays, radium, and other sources of radiation thus replaced the multifarious harmful agents that had been tested and found wanting as mutagens, including, among others, continuous and intermittent rotation, very high temperatures, very low temperatures, and, in one failed attempt to mutagenize white rats, 10 successive generations of daily exposure to alcohol fumes (“the young of 10 generations of alcoholic ancestors were both physically and mentally the equals of the controls and in some cases slightly superior”). Muller’s finding inspired !', 'year': 2009}, {'paperId': '63d5f8cddc3d89d4b5021731018889130a911cca', 'title': 'The Continuing Story of the Yiddish Language: The Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Massachusetts', 'abstract': 'Abstract The focus of my article is a unique place, the Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Massachusetts, which connects Yiddish culture with the American one, the experience of the Holocaust with the descendants of the survivors, and a modern idea of Jewishness with the context of American postmodernity. Created in the 1980s, in the mind of a young and enthusiastic student Aaron Lansky, the Yiddish Book Center throughout the years has become a unique place on the American cultural map. Traversing the continents and crossing borders, Lansky and his co-workers for over thirty years have been saving Yiddish language books from extinction. The Center, however, has long stopped to be merely a storage house for the collection, but instead has grown into a vibrant hub of Yiddishkeit in the United States. Its employees do not only collect, distribute, digitalize and post online the forgotten volumes, but also engage in diverse activities, scholarly and cultural, that promote the survival of the tradition connected with Yiddish culture. They educate, offering internships and fellowships to students interested in learning Yiddish from across the world, translate, publish, and exhibit Yiddish language materials, in this way finding new users for the language whose speakers were virtually annihilated by the Holocaust. To honour their legacy, a separate project is aimed at conducting video interviews that record life testimonies of the speakers of Yiddish. Aaron Lansky’s 2004 memoir, Outwitting History, provides an interesting insight into the complexities of his arduous life mission.

The students, who ranged in age from fourteen to eighteen, had been brought there on a fieldtrip by Mark Rader, a science teacher who had hoped that exposure to the film would encourage them to think about racial injustice and discrimination (Spolar Cl). Although the Jewish Community Relations Council had prepared a study guide in conjunction with the Holocaust Center of Northern California and sent it to the Oakland School District, it did not arrive in time for Rader to use, and according to his own account, he did little to prepare the students for what they were about to see outside of warning them to be on their best behavior (Levin 3). Some students later claimed that the majority of them didn\\'t know about the Holocaust and had completed no lessons on the subject at Castlemont (Blacks and Jews). Matinee attendees that day remember the talking and laughter as going on continuously until the projector was turned off one hour into the film (BlacL· and Jews). Students and their chaperons later claimed that the behavior that caused the most outrage, a comment and laughter after a Nazi shot a female Jewish architect in the head, involved only ten of the students at the most (Spolar Cl). Among the group of offended theater patrons were Holocaust survivors, according to the theater manager (Rich 17). As the students were marched out of the theater, about half of the remaining 450 spectators burst into spontaneous applause (Mowatt AlO). Both the students and the majority of the remaining authence may have thought they could put the incident behind them and continue with their field trip or the film, but someone tipped off the local Bay Area news media, and that applause became the opening shot in a salvo of accusations and recriminations that eventually became a national scandal, culminating nearly three months later in director Steven Spielberg\\'s appearance, along with California Governor Pete Wilson, at a Castlemont school assembly. This paper examines how a conflict within an authence at a single movie screening became the subject of a national news scandal. The witness testimony I use as support should be read not as definitive accounts of the incident, but rather as symptomatic of the very discourses that generated and sustained the scandal. Since most of the interviews were made after significant attention had already been given the incident, it is impossible to determine to what extent the controversy reflected the rhetoric of the students and other authence members or vice versa. What is clear, though, is that very specific events and discourses in the contemporary historical context predisposed the media to portray the incident as an example of outrageously inappropriate and insensitive behavior by possible anti-Semitic black youth while ignoring questions of the appropriateness of the film for students that age, the educational value of the film in general, and, most crucially, the nature of ordinary youth, and particularly black youth, behavior in movie theaters. The Castlemont story appeared during a time of widespread reporting about a perceived crisis in relations between blacks and Jews. This rift had first come into the national consciousness during the 1991 series of riots that took place in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, a neighborhood largely inhabited by Hassidic Jews and Afro-Caribbeans.1 Concerns about relations between the two communities had been reactivated just a month and a half before the Castlemont incident when Khalid Abdul Muhammad, a former officer in the Nation of Islam, gave a speech at Kean College in New Jersey, during which he notoriously referred to Jews as the \"bloodsuckers of the black community\" (Martello 3). …', 'year': 2009}, {'paperId': '64c19a731837d30bbc746348e6c776636b877b78', 'title': \"Hava N'Halela : Tzipora Jochsberger and Her Vision for the Hebrew Arts School\", 'abstract': \"Tzipora Jochsberger (1920–) educator, composer, and musicologist, dreamed of using the arts to introduce Jews to the richness of their heritage.

The experiences they endured during WWII were thought to impair their parental functioning. A trans-generational transmission of the trauma has been reported by clinicians and by researchers exploring the vulnerability of the adult offspring when facing major stressful events. However, the two previous epidemiological studies conducted so far failed to show enhanced psychopathology when the children of the Holocaust survivors were compared with suitable controls. Methods: In the Israel-component of the World Mental Health Survey offspring of Holocaust survivors were identified (N=430) and compared to offspring of Europe-born parents who did not reside in Nazi-occupied countries (N=417) on several measures of psychopathology and physical health dimensions that have a marked psychological components, and on health and mental health help-seeking practices. Results: No statistical differences were elicited between both groups on all those domains. Conclusions: Apparently, Holocaust survivor parents succeeded to spare their children from the untoward consequences of the psychological wounds and scars of their traumatic past. Survivors strived to secure a better and safer life for their children as evidenced by the relatively higher level of education that the offspring of the survivors were able to achieve than the comparison group, although their own educational career was truncated. Also, separations from parents until the end of adolescence of the children did not differ between the two groups. Research findings on the effects of the Holocaust experience on the survivors have consistently shown higher levels of psychopathology compared with adequate controls, shortly and even long after World War II ended (1, 2). Those findings were made in different countries and in studies based on clinical and community samples. Importantly, these studies were unrelated to compensation claims (1). Clinicians subsequently reported that the children of the survivors were equally affected (3–5). This was not surprising as Holocaust survivors were suspected to be impaired in their parental functioning (6). Factors such as bereavement, the ghost of past severe traumatic experiences during and immediately after WWII, hastily contracted marriages after liberation, concern about a safe future, compounded by pogroms upon return to the original places of residence, immigration, and exposure to war-related stressors in Israel were all assumed to build an adverse scenario with regard to successful parenting (1). For example, authors raised the hypotheses that processes related to child rearing, such as separation-individuation (7) and attachment (8) might be disrupted. Today, the picture that emerges from a vast literature on the mental health of children of Holocaust survivors is more complex. Community-based epidemiological inquiries, which are not based on illness behavior, cast a doubt on the above findings (9, 10). Indeed, reviewers (11, 12) concluded that clinical and community studies fail to concur. Whereas “...clinical studies tend to present a specific ‘psychological profile’ that includes a predisposition to PTSD, various difficulties in separation-individuation and a contradictory mix of resilience and vulnerability when coping with stress...” (12), Isr J Psychiatry Relat Sci Vol 44 No. 2 (2007) 144–151 Address for Correspondence: Itzhak Levav, MD, Ministry of Health, 2 Ben Tabai Street, Jerusalem 93591, Israel. E-mail: Itzhak.Levav@moh.health.gov.il community surveys do not show that the offspring of the survivors differ from well-selected comparison populations. Admittedly, the clinical studies were not uniform with regard to their findings. As noted by reviewers, several of those studies failed to support the notion that psychopathology in the first generation is transmitted to the second. In addition, not all of the clinical studies were free from methodological shortcomings (1, 5). Yet, for many practitioners the existence or lack of existence of the “second generation syndrome” has not reached closure, especially since a set of well designed studies have identified vulnerability factors in the offspring with regard to the reaction to stressors such as being diagnosed with breast cancer (13, 14), and exposure to war actions (15). In these cases, samples of female and male children of Holocaust survivors, respectively, showed higher measures of psychopathology than comparison groups. Analogously, Yehuda et al. found that the offspring of survivors compared to suitable comparison groups reacted to traumatic events with higher frequency of PTSD and/or other psychiatric disorders (16). Yehuda et al. also showed that the vulnerability in the offspring of Holocaust survivors expresses itself through the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis with lower cortisol levels than controls (17). In view of the contrasting findings obtained in those three different sources of data, further epidemiological exploration would seem to be fully justified provided the new study offers comparative advantages with regard to previous work in both its methodology and domains covered. The Israeli component of the World Mental Health Survey provided us with such an opportunity (18). In this community study, offspring of Holocaust survivors and of Europe-born parents who had not resided in Nazi-occupied countries were included in a large countrywide survey. The outcome variables comprised a number of factors that had not been researched in the two earlier community studies (9, 10), such as use of services, self-appraisal of health, self-reported physical health conditions, and suicidal behavior. Psychopathological domains that had been explored in those past studies, such as emotional distress and mood and anxiety disorders, complement these new measures. Methods and Procedures Survey sample selection This inquiry was nested in the Israeli component of the World Mental Health Survey (WMH). Accordingly, it followed the procedures established by the World Health Organization and Harvard University in the approximately 30 countries that participated in the survey (18). Our sample was extracted from the National Population Register (NPR) and comprised non-institutionalized de jure residents aged 21 and over. The sample was designed to reflect a distribution of respondents combining gender-agepopulation groups (Arabs, Jews: Israel-born or preand post-1990 immigrants from the former USSR). In large localities (N=73), where approximately 80% of the total population live, a one-stage stratified sample was drawn. Each stratum was defined as a combination of population group, age and gender. The records in each stratum were sorted by geographic characteristics and a systematic sample was drawn. In small localities (N=1113), a two-stage sample was drawn. First, the localities were assigned to 33 strata according to localization, size and type (e.g., village, kibbutz). A systematic sample of localities was drawn from each stratum with probability proportional to their size; 89 localities were selected, at least two localities in each stratum. In the second stage, the sampling rate was set so that the final probability of individuals was fixed across localities. A systematic sample of individuals in the sampled localities was drawn from the NPR, after sorting the records by population group, age and gender. On average, 15 respondents were selected in each locality. The interviewed sample was weighted back to the total population to compensate for unequal selection probabilities resulting from disproportionate stratification, clustering effects and non-response. The weights were adjusted to make weighted sample totals conform to known population totals taken from reliable Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) sources. Face-to-face interviews at the homes of respondents were conducted from May 2003 to April 2004.

The understanding that collective memory can be preserved only through proactive efforts led to the development of formal and informal curricula for Holocaust education. The main assumption is that Holocaust education has the potential to generate a moral transformation. In light of this conclusion the question is: What kind of changes do we seek and how should we accomplish them? This study deals with a case study of one of the constitutive historical events of the 20 century: commemoration of the Holocaust. The study focuses on the Experiential Learning Method of educating about Holocaust remembrance and commemoration and about Holocaust monuments. Over the years memorial centers have been added, which contain additional monuments commemorating the story of a specific place and/or personal stories. One of the currently customary methods of commemoration in Israel is the journey to Poland, to the labor, concentration, and death camps, to the various memorial sites and monuments. This journey is undertaken by young and old, groups and singles, from all over the world and particularly from Israel. Since many of those taking the journey are young people at an age when personal, national, and historical identity is formed, a time when the young acquire their educational values, it is particularly important to ascertain who is charged with passing on the beacon of memory. This leads to weighty questions regarding the identity of the guides who lead these journeys and the contents they choose to impart to the participants, the guidance sites, and the method of guidance. Who will tell the story? How will the story be told? What will remain of the story? This study discusses in addition, a case study of guides from Israel charged with imparting this chapter of human history. In order to explore their impact, interviews were held with 47 guides, the large majority of whom are Israeli born, a majority academics, and many hold advanced degrees. The research findings indicate that they aim the commemoration beacon primarily at guidance sites in Poland. The study explored other diverse essential parameters regarding the profile of “guides to Poland” – where did they study? What is their personal affiliation with the subject? What is their position on the universal and Jewish narrative of the Holocaust? In light of the interviews conducted, it appears that almost all of them have the necessary tools to convey the most complete and comprehensive educational message. Accordingly, this issue was explored and most of the guides reported that the most influential message of commemoration is conveyed primarily through visits to camps and ghettos in Poland. This conclusion generates a theoretical, practical, philosophical, moral, and educational question indicating the “exporting of historical memory”. Should our entire educational focus indeed be exclusively on Poland? How can we preserve the ethos of the affiliation between the Holocaust of the Jews and heroism in the Holocaust, as well as heroism in Israel and its building, if we disregard the many commemoration and memorial sites within Israel? Do the journeys to the camps and to the valley of death in Poland, which are led by these guides, not create a distortion in the instilling of Holocaust remembrance and heritage, by disregarding the many commemoration sites and monuments throughout Israel? Aiming the beacon of commemoration at Poland, outside Israel, prevents exposure of the public, and particularly teenagers, to the natural association formed in Israel between Holocaust and revival, which preserves the connecting link between the', 'year': 2022}, {'paperId': '65c06c0bb7ea7ff86c2ec03078cff2b9574d435c', 'title': 'The Atomic Bomb in Japanese Cinema Critical Essays', 'abstract': \"Seventy years after the nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan is still dealing with the effects of the bombings on the national psyche.

Clifford’s survey of the development of memory agency since the 1970s is particularly insightful for understanding the difficulties arising for child survivors both from the testimonial framework and the rhetoric of legacies used by certain oral history projects. The construction of well-composed accounts aligned to set expectations of linear, coherent narratives with a redemptive message inevitably involves stylizing experiences and suppressing the sense of uncertainty, rupture, and loss inherent to child survivor stories. Some interviewees try to meet such audience expectations, while others choose to maintain the authenticity of their fragmented stories. In analyzing key experiences of child survivors such as the immediate postwar resettlement in pan-European and global locations, the restitution process started with the West German Federal Indemnification Law of 1953, and the late recognition of the specific child survivor status in the 1990s, Clifford impressively balances the “telling” of the story from the children’s perspectives with interludes focused on the visions and expectations of the adults. There is sometimes a slight tendency to amplify the aspect of child agency and the female voice.

He wanted to keep his medical condition private; USA To day trumped his desire for privacy by publishing his condition. The students discussed the ethical and reporting dilemmas that USA Today faced. Did Ashe, as a public figure, have a right to privacy? Or does journalism have a responsibility to detail the health conditions of public figures? What about the journalists who knew Ashe had AIDS? Why did they not publish? Should they have? Without dissent, the students called USA Today\\'s actions reprehensible. \"It\\'s unfair. Journalists don\\'t know how much they hurt people,\" they said. \"It\\'s unethical. How does it serve the public?\" they asked. \"Reporters acted like piranhas,\" they said. Undergraduate indignation ruled. The professor sat silently in the front row during the hour-long discussion. Then he stood and said: \"So. You think the press treated Arthur Ashe shamelessly and without conscience.\" The class nodded, murmuring assent. \"Then why are you in a school of journalism that will socialize you to act in the very same way?\" he asked and walked from the classroom.

Both journalism and journalism education have become far more complicated endeavors because of changes in social mores, technology, politics, corporate consolidation of media companies, and a perceived rise of sins represented in plagiarism and other scandals. Yet, as journalism educators, we have only so many credit-hours to teach our students what they need to know to become journalists of credibility, character, compassion, and craft.

Both, to steal the subtitle of Shop Talk \"examine the profession\" in terms of professional, ethical, and emotional competence. Shop Talk, a series of previously published excerpts from speeches, articles, text chapters, and lectures collected and edited by Jan Winburn, more readily adapts to a journalism skills course. As the Atlanta JournalConstitution\\'s Winburn says in her introduction, Shop Talk provides insight into essential news writing, editing, and interviewing skills; observations on all types of beat coverage; discussion of ethics and related issues; and a look forward into the multimedia issues journalists may face. This is not, however, merely another \"how-to\" book; rather, the essayists reveal the human side of practicing the craft as well as explaining their best practices. This is a notable difference from standard texts many educators use. Many essayists offer motivation for journalism students to strive for competence and instruction regarding the difficulty of balancing their humanity and journalistic duties.

The questions of this research are: What were the motivational factors of H.Ss. that enabled them to build a successful life? What were their difficulties in overcoming the trauma and achieving their goals? The present study uses a qualitative methodology in a descriptive–interpretive constructivist approach. It describes and clarifies a complex phenomenon from subjects` personal point of view. The data was processed from 2 sources: interviews with 12 Survivors, and my reflections following the interviews. A content analysis was then performed, and categories and sub-categories were extracted. The research findings show that all of the Survivors interviewed for this study wished to continue living, despite the loss, the suffering and the traumas they had experienced. They had different motivations for wanting to continue living and succeeding, like the need for a meaningful life, their need to belong, work, believe in ideology, to be together and achieve self fulfillment. Success meant different things to the people interviewed. The main difficulties indicated by the Survivors were emotional isolation, disturbing memories, loneliness, fear, and insecurity, the attitude of the local population to the H.Ss and absorption difficulties. Some of them concealed and repressed Holocaust experiences, some of the Survivors may wear the success mask even nowadays, others started to share their traumatic experiences with their environment and their families after 60 years of silence.', 'year': 2011}, {'paperId': '67a0626808aacb29bb83f8875e6b843c16359b79', 'title': '„Język, którym mówi dzisiejsza władza, jest ideologiczny”.

In this interview, Michal Glowinski, Professor Emeritus at the Institute of Literary Research (IBL), writer, author of numerous literary and scholarly publications, including Zla mowa [Bad Speech], a Polish Jew who survived the Holocaust, shares his traumatic memories and talks about verbal aggression, which is an alarm bell warning that physical aggression is to come. Following the tragic events of the mid-twentieth century, language can no longer be treated as “the house of being”: before the first brick of extermination camps was laid, the word of hatred had thundered first. This is why it is so important to remember the past and to carefully analyse the language of the present, so that the horrible story of the Holocaust can never happen again. The Holocaust is the greatest tragedy of the twentieth century, which brutally destroyed millions of Jews. It also put an end to survivors’ hope of achieving a harmony of self-identity. The Holocaust must be remembered. Literature is one of the tools for keeping it in memory and taking a closer look at all the crimes that were committed. The painful experience of the Holocaust has been reflected in the works of Jewish writers. It is also at the roots of tragic contradictions, the sense of internal emptiness and loss of empathy. „Jezyk, ktorym mowi dzisiejsza wladza, jest ideologiczny”.

After all, what better source for hands-on advice on the subject of everlasting love and commitment than his grandparents, who had been married for 65 years? Along with his co-director Skyler Gross, Brandon set out to interview his grandparents and, in the process, inadvertently put a spotlight on what would become his family’s greatest revelation: That his cherished Nani and Popi kept a secret their entire lives together and that their relationship was far more complicated than anyone realized. “On My Way Out: The Secret Life of Nani And Popi” is a must-see film in which Popi reveals that he is gay. Nani and Popi were born in Europe, met before the war and reunited in the aftermath of surviving the horrors of the Holocaust. They married, emigrated to Los Angeles and had two daughters. To the outside world, Nani and Popi embodied the American Dream. Popi always knew he was gay and says he was born into a world that didn’t understand human nature. Nani found out by mistake when she called a bathhouse he was supposedly visiting but was told he hadn’t been there that day. When she confronted him, he told her the truth. Their decision to hide the secret and continue their life together stemmed from their staunch and cherished belief that marriage is for life. No wonder their grandson looked towards them for their secret, and in doing so, uncovered a far deeper one. As altruistic as the “married for life” sentiment may sound, there is an underlying theme of lack of choice, which Popi articulates to his grandson, stating that his options were to either commit suicide or live in a closet. “I decided to live,” he says. This is a sentiment often echoed by Holocaust survivors, and the irony of surviving a concentration camp and still not living freely is not lost on the audience. The pure magic of this film is the portrayal of a deep and beautiful relationship that is perhaps flawed, but real and devoted. Nani gave Popi the space to be himself within the confines of societal pressures at the time, and he remained committed to their closely knit family. There is nothing phony in finding out that this marriage is not what it seemed; in fact, there is something even more compelling in discovering that their commitment to each other was life-long despite a difficult and complicated reality. Never talking about their secret was part of the deal that Nani and Popi made, but secrets weigh heavily and take their toll. At 95, Popi feels the need to unburden himself and live an authentic life to its fullest. “For 90 years I was in pain and still am. Why should I take it to my grave?” Popi is open and forthcoming on his way out of both the closet and the material world and has come to terms with his sexuality, humanity, and true-self. Nani remains closed, having kept the secret she was hoping she’d take to her grave. Nani has dementia, which is perhaps a saving grace for her as the audience senses that she would never have agreed to discuss the secret otherwise. In one scene, she denies admitting to her daughter that Popi is gay. Although the revelation rocks and upends everything the family knew as true and real, the acceptance and support they provide to Nani and Popi are unconditional and profound.

The topic is focused on Urban Native Americans because it is this population that has a multitude of risk factors and it is this population in general that will be most likely to participate in mainstream mental health settings. This study aimed to allow the participants to give voice to their individual stories and experiences regarding Native American historical trauma. Furthermore, the participants were divided into the three generation groups (young adult, middle adult, and elder) to illustrate any intergenerational differences in the experience and transmission of historical trauma. Participants were recruited from the Native American Health Center in Oakland, California and via www.craigslist.org. Fifteen participants took part in this study, which utilized a qualitative method. Interview questions were developed by the researcher and based on previous research on historical trauma in Jewish Holocaust survivors as well as conceptual-analytic research on historical trauma in Native Americans. Part A of the interview questions consists of demographic questions, intended to gather a better picture of the participants' backgrounds. The main themes of the questions in Part B include knowledge of history, relationship with the Native American community, relations with their family, and personal effects of historical trauma. In addition, the results of this study reveal that the majority of participants are grappling with the effects of Historical Trauma. Such effects manifest in feelings of anger towards the dominant cultural group, feelings of responsibility towards their cultural group, and feelings of connectedness with their Native American ancestors regardless of connectedness with one's own family. Trauma symptoms in the form of traumatic dream imagery and depressive ideation were reported by the majority of participants despite the majority of participants reported growing up disconnected from their tribal cultures and customs. There was a generational difference in how participants gained knowledge of their history and culture in that all of the participants in the elder group more likely to report gaining knowledge through a family elder. This study revealed that urban Native Americans do experience psychological effects related to historical trauma.

The action played a highly controversial role in the history of the Jewish self-rescue actions that elaborated in recent historiography. Instead of examining the negotiations between the SS and the Hungarian Zionist Rescue Committee, this study explores how the passengers of the Kasztner train narrated their controversial plight in their diaries, memoirs, and interviews. The inquiry seeks to uncover the history of the Kasztner action from a bottom-up perspective focusing on what was the role of news and rumors about the release in the narratives of the survivors. Hungarian Jewish families, i.e. the “Kasztner Jews” aspired to travel to Palestine, landed finally in Switzerland but directly left from Nazi-occupied Hungary to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. The majority of them were spending months in a special sector of the camp between June and December 1944. The circumstances in the Hungarian Camp where the inmates were treated as “hostages” by the Nazis were unusual compared to the other – ordinary – camp sectors of Bergen-Belsen or other concentration camps. Due to this special status, the “Kasztner Jews” were not in emergency considering they did not suffer from starvation, aggression, and illnesses that lead to death. However, they were held under Nazi jurisdiction and were imprisoned by the SS, and were not convinced about their long-awaited survival.\\nThe accounts written during the months spent in Bergen-Belsen shed light on the flow of information between prisoners in a particular situation. Attitudes to the news and interpretations were influenced by the ideological, religious, and personal background of the “Kasztner Jews”. The differences within the group determined the access to information: the Zionist leaders and their families were much more informed but everyone became part of the information network created by the participants to a certain degree. The uncertain plight and the vulnerability to the Nazis evolved ideas and visions of the possible future. The so-called rumor culture was a major phenomenon that featured everyday life. People who were consistently isolated from credible sources of information became both the creators and the consumers of the news. Besides the uncertainty, the moral ambiguity of Kasztner action was reflected in the participants’ narratives. Their attitudes towards the news were largely determined by the conclusions they drew about their own situation and future, which were influenced not only by their political orientation but also by their family situation. The condition of the prisoners from Auschwitz aroused sympathy and pity among them. On the other hand, the poor physical condition of these prisoners reinforced their privileged position. News of potential deportation from Budapest was also at the center of the discussions. Those who feared for their family members and relatives who were on the train and those who stayed in Budapest were trapped. When they heard the good news, they were glad that family members who stayed in Budapest were secure from deportation.

Saidel. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 2006. 279 pp. $21.90. As the number of Holocaust survivors who are able to tell their histories decreases, the urgency increases to leave a record of their experiences. It is this that has motivated Dr. Rochelle Saidel to document the experiences of the inmates of Ravensbriick concentration camp and, in particulat, those of the Jewish inmates of Ravensbriick. In so doing, she has provided a well-researched account that is valuable both to scholars of the Holocaust and to friends and descendants of the Jewish women of Ravensbruck. Dr. Saidel is the founder of the Remember the Women Institute, which is dedicated to the remembrance of the women of Ravensbriick and to the continued historical research of this unique camp and its enormously strong inmate population. This book exemplifies the purpose of this Institute. In parallel to the narratives of the survivors is the narrative of the struggle to realize the Jewish identity of the inmates through history and through recognition at the Mahn- und Gedenhtatte Ravensbruck. Dr. Saidel began making contact with the survivors at the 50th anniversary of the camp\\'s liberation in 1995. She was able to contact other Jewish survivors with the assistance of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, which provided a mailing list of survivors as well as a cover letter for her initial contact. From this list of 300 survivors, Dr. Saidel received sixty replies, with most women completing the questionnaire and often supplying additional names. Dr. Saidel has interviewed many of these Jewish survivors and their descendants in Brazil, Europe, the U.S., and Israel. Of the 132,000 prisoners of Ravensbriick, 117,000 were killed or died there. Jewish women were a minority among the inmates of Ravensbriick, comprising about 20 percent of die population, and their story has heretofore never been told. And although there are memorials to these prisoners at Ravensbruck, they are grouped according to nationality. As recendy as 1980, the Jewish prisoners were not memorialized separately but together with their fellow inmates of a nation, with often inappropriate results-the Polish Jews were memorialized as a part of all Polish prisoners in a room with a large crucifix. It was this lack of singular identification that motivated Dr. Saidel to begin her research into the lives, and often deaths, of the Jewish inmates of Ravensbriick. Now there is a Jewish memorial at the camp, and this book, too, serves as a memorial to these women. Beginning with a history of the camp, Dr. Saidel describes what she refers to as \"a special hell for women.\" Indeed, Ravensbruck was unique in that it was built for female resisters and political prisoners. …', 'year': 2007}, {'paperId': '6b8a0a95bf454659751c3696ca7c7203634a451c', 'title': '\"Hoffentlich werde ich taugen.\" Zu Situation und Kontext von Brigitte Schwaiger/Eva Deutsch Die Galizianerin', 'abstract': 'The article explores the situation, post-Holocaust Viennese society and rising anti-Semitism in Waldheim-Austria, and the background against which Schwaiger, an established mainstream Austrian author, writes the life history of Deutsch, a Holocaust survivor from Silesia whose native language is Yiddish.

My reading of David's life is based upon two interviews, the first from 1982 (at age 54) and the second from 1995 (at age 67). I employ a method of structural interpretation, “narrative mapping,” which is based upon the work of Labov and Waletzky (1967), in order to visualize the amount of overall consistency between the two interviews. I also carefully study individual narratives that are repeated over time. My reading of David's interviews suggests strong consistency along with significant changes. There is enormous consistency in the structure and content of narratives but differences in the point or evaluations of narratives. I also argue that David's later interview is more fully developed; David's later interview contains several new narratives and integrates historical insights into his account of the past. I discuss the merits of two explanations for this change, culture and time in development.

Even after he became a national celebrity in Israel?a result due both to his writings and to his spectacular appearance at the trial of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann, in which he fell unconscious on the witness stand?Ka-Tzetnik refused to allow his photograph to appear on the jackets of any of his books, would not speak in public or grant interviews, and did not attend ceremonies for the presentation of the Ka-Tzetnik book prize, an award endowed in his honor by one of his admirers.1 Only a transformative experience in the 1980s, when he was almost seventy, led him to modify his attempt to live a symbolic life as a pseudonym. When Salamandra was published in 1946, the process of gathering first-hand testimony about the ghettoes and death camps was just beginning. Ka-Tzetnik's book, written in Hebrew and published in a Palestine preoccupied with the postwar struggle for a Jewish state, attracted little attention elsewhere; it was not published in English until 1977.2 His second Holocaust volume, House of Dolls, based on his sister's gruesome fate as a prisoner in a concentration-camp brothel, appeared in 1956 and had considerably greater success. It was promptly translated into numerous other languages, and the English version had gone through fifty printings by 1977.3 House of Dolls was followed by Atrocity (also known as Piepet), based on the experiences of the author's younger brother, and Phoenix over the Galilee, in which the main character from Salamandra sought his place in the new state of Israel.4 In Israel in the 1950s and 1960s, Ka-Tzetnik became a best-selling author, especially\", 'year': 2002}, {'paperId': '6e3090f7c165fe440a6f87960ca56978b02e93dc', 'title': 'Entrevistando sobreviventes do Holocausto: reflexões sobre a construção de um arquivo', 'abstract': 'This article analyses the cataloguing system applied to a collection of interviews of survivors of the Holocaust by the Shoah Foundation, a non-profit organization created in the U.S. in 1994.

This is not how most people today measure their own success or that of their family or country. For the academic, the more familiar measures of success include tenure, academic rank, number of publications, citation count, and that most important of all measures, annual salary. Political and economic analysts have similar measures for the success of countries: annual GDP growth, political influence, military power, literacy rates, and the like.Biologists are the only profession that measures success the way Abraham, his mentor, and the author of the Book of Genesis did. Rabbits are a successful species because they are plentiful, and the California condor is unsuccessful because the species is teetering on the brink of extinction. Ecologists use number of individuals and total biomass as quantitative measures of species success. In evolutionary and medical genetics, the success of a gene is defined by its fitness: average number of offspring surviving to reproductive age for gene carriers, divided by average number of surviving offspring in the general population.In the study of human diversity, the important units are cultural, religious, ethnic, linguistic and racial groups. Abraham's tribe is one of them: one of the world's most successful, as evidenced by its survival through three millennia. On page 297 of this issue, Jelena Cvorovic and Kosta Nikolic present the most detailed study yet about the demography of Serbian Jews. Their subjects are the human equivalent of an endangered species. As detailed in their article, close to 80% of the Serbian Jewish population were wiped out in the holocaust, followed by emigration to Israel of many of the 6000 survivors. Less than 2000 remain today. Cvorovic personally interviewed about 30% of them, and gained insights into the circumstances of their demographic decline. While the horrors of the holocaust were obviously the main reason, additional factors include emigration, low fertility, secularism leading to disassociation from the remaining Jewish community, and intermarriage with non-Jews. The authors also observe that Jews have made contributions to culture, politics and the economy in Serbia that are out of proportion to their small numbers. In a separate study on page 352 of this issue, Lynn and Cvorovic offer a plausible explanation for these outstanding achievements: high average intelligence of the Serbian Jews.It is instructive to compare the Serbian Jews with another ethnic group that has been studied by Cvorovic in great detail (see book review on page383of this issue): the Roma, also known as Gypsies. Although decimated by Nazi persecution (though not as profoundly as the Jews), the Roma in Serbia and the other Balkan countries are thriving - demographically, at least. In her recent book about this group, Cvorovic (2014) observes that fertility rates of the Balkan Roma, though declining, are about twice those of the non-Roma population. In consequence, their proportion in the ethnic mix of the Balkan countries is rising despite their higher mortality. By this measure, the Roma are perhaps the most successful indigenous European group today. Although demographic particulars are uncertain, Cvorovic estimates the present sizes of Roma minorities as between 1% and 5% in most Balkan countries. The Roma do less well on other measures of success, with high rates of poverty and unemployment and the lowest IQs measured in any modern European population (Cvorovic and Lynn, 2014; Dumitrascu, 1998). …\", 'year': 2015}, {'paperId': '6efea40272faff40909f5898783254b6957d8729', 'title': 'Psychological-Mindedness and American Indian Historical Trauma: Interviews with Service Providers from a Great Plains Reservation.', 'abstract': 'The concept of historical trauma (HT) was developed to explain clinical distress among descendants of Jewish Holocaust survivors and has since been ascribed new meanings to account for suffering in diverse contexts. In American Indian (AI) communities, the concept of AI HT has been tailored and promoted as an expanded notion of trauma that combines psychological injury with historical oppression to causally connect experiences with Euro-American colonization to contemporary behavioral health disparities. However, rather than clinical formulations emphasizing psychological injury, a focused content analysis of interviews with 23 AI health and human service providers (SPs) on a Great Plains reservation demonstrated strong preferences for socio-cultural accounts of oppression.

We analyzed semistructured interviews taken with 8 survivors of the bombs—5 from Nagasaki and 3 from Hiroshima. Our research questions were: When the survivors talk about their experiences, what do they focus on and with what are they preoccupied? What can we learn about the long-term effects of the experiences from both psychological and physical aspects? And, where does the A-bomb experience “fit” into the survivors' lives? Our analyses showed that there were 9 main themes that emerged from the interviews that could be grouped into two main categories—themes connected to the experience itself and themes connected to life afterward.

Method: The method consisted of systematic textual analysis of semi-structured interviews with six Jewish women born after the war who were children of concentration camp interned Holocaust survivors. Results: Four superordinate themes were identified: heightened awareness of parents' Holocaust survivor status, parenting style, overidentification with parents' experiences and transmission of fear and mistrust. These were found despite the variation in parental communication. Conclusions: The data suggest that unconscious processes are at least partially involved in the transmission of trauma. A form of projective identification is proposed as an explanatory mechanism which brings together diverse aspects of the observed phenomena: projection by the parent of Holocaust-related feelings and anxieties into the child; introjection by the child as if she herself had experienced the concentration camps; and return of this input by the child in the form of compliant and solicitous behaviour associated with enmeshment and individuation problems.

In-depth interviews were conducted with 21 community-dwelling survivors aged 65 and over. Credibility was ensured by methodological triangulation and peer debriefing. The study highlighted the importance of understanding older survivors’ ageing and aged care experiences in the context of their entire lifecourse and in terms of both vulnerability and resilience. It showed that trauma history can heighten older survivors’ sensitivity to many aspects of the social and physical environments in residential, community and home-based aged care settings. The study also uncovered the potential for aged care services to help older survivors cope with the psycho-social and emotional effects of resurfacing post-traumatic stress symptoms. The implications of the study findings for care practice include the importance of recognising older survivors of genocide as a distinct group of clients and the need to distinguish staff training for caring for this client group from general cultural awareness training.', 'year': 2012}, {'paperId': '70ce0acadd55fb5be95468d593a71a1860b38a58', 'title': 'Approaching an Auschwitz survivor : holocaust testimony and its transformations', 'abstract': 'List of illustrations and maps Forword Introduction: What Does it Mean?

Narratives, both oral and written, play an important role in helping the individual make sense of their lives and the world they live in. Narrative research is focused on the elicitation and interpretation of people’s narrative accounts of their lived experiences. In recent decades, there has been an enormous growth in the use of narrative inquiry and narrative-based research with diverse theoretical orientations and methodologies grounded in various disciplines of the social sciences and humanities including anthropology, psychology, psycholinguistics, sociology, history and literary studies as well as in medicine and clinical research (Chase, 2005, 2011; Holstein & Gubrium, 2012; Kleinman, 1988; Charon, 2006). According to Chase (2005), most narrative researchers treat narrative as a distinctive form of discourse that shapes meaning through the concerted ordering of story material with speakers providing particular understandings of personal action and experiences by organizing events and objects into meaningful patterns, connecting subjects, actions, events, and their consequences over time. \\nAs narrative research has become increasingly complex and rigorous, this special issue was planned to gain insight into the narrative research being conducted by international scholars with a focus on women and trauma, broadly defined. The call for papers attracted many high-quality submissions from authors representing various countries. The special issue contains a collection of ten papers, each providing a unique perspective and understanding of trauma in women’s lives and its reflection in narrative inquiry. Just as women’s voices are varied, so too are the narratives presented. Women are represented as narrators; as subjects of the narration and as characters in the narrative. The authors also present a broad spectrum of approaches to the empirical analysis of narrative material ranging from social media content, life stories, clinical and educational interventions, and literary works. \\xa0 \\nIn the first paper of the special issue, Bifulco’s article seeks to explore links between selected investigative child abuse interview accounts using narratives elicited through the Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse (CECA) clinical interview guide and analyzed using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Counts (LIWC) text analysis programme (Francis & Pennebaker, 1992) which identifies characteristics of speech associated with trauma. Her paper examines the potential of combining these approaches to systematically analyze and interpret trauma narratives. \\nIn the second article, the contextual backdrop for the narratives is the COVID-19 pandemic. In her article, Kostruba analyzes narratives collected online to gain an understanding of how specific social restrictions, stay-at-home orders particular to the pandemic affected all aspects of life including psychological well-being. Her study also used LIWC psycholinguistic analysis of these current pandemic narratives to identify markers of traumatic experience and identify possible gender differences in the ways women experienced (and continue to experience) the COVID-19 global pandemic. \\nThe importance of social and cultural context is apparent in the next article which draws on literary texts as the source material. For Aguilar Lopez & Miguel Borge, the drama The Gold Ribbon by María Manuela Reina, written and situated in the 1980s, a decade that for Spain implied a more obvious abandonment of the most traditional conceptions of the role of women, serves as the unit of analysis. The authors describe the divergent worldview models of the older versus younger characters, reflecting both a generational and gender divide around topics such as success, infidelity, and matrimony. Aguilar Lopez & Miguel Borge aim to identify if, how and why the dramatist is able to reach out to the general public through her play to create social awareness and give voice to the women who rebelled against the traditional social and gender roles. \\nThe next paper in this series focuses on the emerging field of post-traumatic growth (PTG) defined by Tedeschi & Calhoun (2004) as a “positive psychological change experienced as a result of the struggle with highly challenging circumstances.” Drawing on therapeutic narratives from women participating in a psychotherapy workshop, Lushyn & Sukhenko utilize dialectical understanding and discourse analysis to identify and assess the women’s descriptions and definitions associated with post-traumatic development and growth with a further attempt to provide practical implications for psychological practice. \\nA set of the articles (#5-7) in this special issue target traumas associated with transition, be it gender transition or women and girls transitioning to another life phase (adolescence; menopause) and the emotional, social and cultural experiences connected to these transitions. \\nMartynyuk’s article combines methodological tools of conceptual metaphor theory and narrative psychology with theoretical assumptions of the intersubjective psycholinguistic approach to meaning making and exploring transgender transition narrative metaphors. Her dataset consists of 16 TED talks videos by transgender individuals discussing their experiences of transitioning which provide Martynyuk the opportunity to conduct a narrative and visual analysis of the metaphors that are given coherence by the textual, social, cultural, and historical context of the narrative, as well as by the interactive situational context reflected in the video recordings. \\nThe article by Nair & George puts the menopausal woman as the focus of the narrative inquiry. The authors interviewed a group of male spouses about their knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about perimenopause and their experiences associated with the physical, psychological, and social changes occurring in the lives of their wives. The menopausal transition can be a period of stress, even lead to trauma if left unnoticed or unsupported. Nair & George used qualitative data software to analyze the interview data and thematic analysis to arrive at themes which could inform programs which could raise awareness about the perimenopausal and menopausal life stages of women to help both partners understand and cope with the individual, family and societal changes which occur during this life period. \\nOn the opposite end of the life spectrum, Shirazi et al, investigate whether narrative-based interventions in the school context can increase children’s emotional intelligence (EI) and whether oral and written narrative elements have a different effect on students' EI. The underlying premise is that children share their emotional experiences through narratives and stories and high-quality narratives are beneficial for children’s wellbeing and development. The research project was conducted with almost one hundred 12-year old Iranian girls who attend Yasuj city schools in southwestern Iran. Results highlighted the importance of oral and combined oral/written language modes and their merged narrative elements on the development of emotional intelligence, particularly for children who are in the language minority. \\nThe final set of articles (#8-10) make use of nostalgia and intergenerational narratives of historical trauma. \\nTodorova & Padareva-Ilieva apply an interdisciplinary and multimodal approach to describe and classify written messages and images collected through social media in Bulgaria during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Findings revealed that much of the communications through social media during that period was largely nostalgic and that the main role of the Facebook social media platform is to unite people in times of isolation, to raise their spirit and save them from the traumatic experience they may encounter during a global health crisis. \\nZaporozhets & Stodolinska analyze the concept of border through a content analysis of the Little House children’s book series which are narrated from the lived experiences and perspective of the author Laura Ingalls Wilder based on her childhood in a settler and pioneer family in the United States in the late 1800s.\\xa0 The territorial and metaphorical borders depicted in Wilder’s works are interwoven and influenced by her reminiscences of historical, biographical, gender, and psychological peculiarities. \\nThis journal issue concludes with a cross-cultural analysis of narrative reflections associated with two 20th century genocides: the Holodomor in Ukraine (1932-1933), and the Holocaust (1939-1944). Zasiekina et al recruited second (“mothers”) and third (“daughters”) generations of Holodomor and Holocaust descendants in Ukraine and Israel to share their family narratives and experiences of the genocide. The study applied inductive thematic analyses that progressed from description to interpretation, and showed the centrality of five emerging themes in both mothers’ and daughters’ narratives. The findings of their research have important implications for future practice of creating narratives with survivors of massive trauma and their offspring and stress the importance of creating a traumatic narrative to aid the healing process resulting from the transmission of historical and collective trauma and provides direction for clinical providers in designing treatment plans for individuals with genocide in their life history. \\nIn summary, the articles that make up this special journal issue reinforce the view that narrative research and inquiry provides researchers and clinicians multiple lenses and approaches through which to analyze and interpret narrative data. The subsequent results of each narrative analysis can give voice to a broad range of women and girls, while at the same time guide policy and inform educational interventions and therapeutic program\", 'year': 2021}, {'paperId': '723ed8e470a1592c7c50fc8db022f12c8b8800c0', 'title': 'Talking and Not Talking about Violence: Challenges in Interviewing Survivors of Atrocity as Whole People', 'abstract': 'Abstract Loosely structured life history interviewing is increasingly the oral history method of choice when interviewing survivors of mass violence. Ideally, it gives the interviewee space to explore and express her or his memories and the connections between them, while emphasizing the context of the experience of violence within a larger life lived. There is, however, an inherent tension in setting out to interview someone about her or his life, as he or she understands it, while being, at the same time, specifically interested in her or his experience of violence. The latter interest immediately categorizes, directs, and betrays a particular understanding of the former: namely, that a person’s life can be interpreted through the lens of one particular set of experiences within it. This article examines two oral history projects that I conducted with survivors of atrocity—one with survivors of World War II and the Bosnian war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the other with Holocaust survivors in Montreal—to explore the limits of framing lives within the context of violence, and to ask how they might be overcome methodologically, ethically, and philosophically. In these projects, some interviewees struggled with not being survivors “enough” to merit being interviewed, and others felt that they were so much more than survivors that such a framing frustrated them. How can we understand someone’s experience and memory of violence without defining her or him, and the interview space, by it? Is a life history project that is interested in memories of atrocity necessarily restrictive and directive, no matter how broadly it tries to present itself? As we oral historians are increasingly concerned with how we understand, interpret, and represent the people to whom we listen, it is crucial to consider this question of framing.', 'year': 2018}, {'paperId': '73098aaa2e5199acbce24d6ffed2d20124734772', 'title': 'Between Witness and Testimony: Survivor Narratives and the Shoah', 'abstract': 'The disaster is related to forgetfulnessforgetfulness without memory, the motionless retreat of what has not been treated . To write . . . is to be in relation, through words in their absence, with what one cannot remember. (Blanchot 1995,121) \"When you\\'re hungry, it gets to a point where you don\\'t mind stealing from your own sister, from your own father ... Now I-you would never picture me, and I can\\'t even imagine myself doing that now. But it happened.\" (Leon W, FVA tape T-2)1 In the last several years, a number of groups and individuals have made an effort to record the memories of those who survived, in one way or another, the utter burn of history. Two of the most notable are the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies at Yale University, established in 1982, and the Survivors of the Shoah Foundation, established with the help of Steven Spielberg in 1994. In addition to recorded oral testimonies, we have those gathered much earlier, recorded with paper and ink: Primo Levi began writing If This is a Man (which, in its later printing, became Survival in Auschwitz) in 1948, less than four years after the liberation of Auschwitz, and countless others have committed to language the memories that haunted them and the realities that confronted them as they were starved, beaten, and left to watch one another be killed or die. In the case of both written and oral testimonies, in spite of the prima facie differences between them, it becomes clear that the distance between what has been witnessed and what can be committed to testimony-what was seen and what can be said-is often wide, but always palpable. And it is palpable not only in the witness\\'s statements but in the shrugged shoulders, the winces, the tears, and the silences that punctuate the oral testimonies and that are aestheticized but not domesticated in the written language of figure. Nathan A\\'s description of an aktion, in which Jewish villagers are asked to dig ditches and then line up at its edge to be shot, along with, later, all of their neighbors, proceeds this way: They used to throw the earth on the top, and the earth used to go up and down because they are living people: One-the son bury his mother; the mother was still alive: \"Moyshe, ikh lebh; bagrub mikh nisht lebedikerheyt\" (\"Moyshe, I\\'m alive; don\\'t bury me while I\\'m alive\"]. . . . But Moyshe had no choice, because the Germans no give him the choice. And he bury alive. [Interviewer:] He buried his mother alive? (FVA tape T-113) At that, Nathan shrugs his shoulders without any facial expression. The shrug of the shoulders and the lack of apparent emotion in this account, as much as the incongruous connection of the pleading of a mother to her son and the statement bereft of anything but description that concludes the episode (\"and he bury alive\"), mark a point between witness and testimony that can be seen as a moment of trauma, a moment in which the historical real and the memory of it as demanded by the imperative to testify to it disintegrate and present for both the witness and the interviewer (as well as those who are present to view or listen to the testimony) a break.This moment, this break, is neither a site of historical facticity nor a kernel of \"truth\" nor the recovery, for the witness, of the moment by way of memory. It is, in Cathy Caruth\\'s words, a moment in which the object-in this case, the moment not of the son burying his mother, but of Nathan A.\\'s witnessing of the acts he attempts to describe--is \"grasped only in the very inaccessibility of its occurrence\" (1991, 187) in which the object is denoted not by the words but is borne by the shrug, the connective \"and:\\' and the impassive face of Nathan A. as he confronts the interviewer. In Binjamin Wilkomirski\\'s Fragments: Memories of a Wartime Childhood, there are equally devastating moments in which the writer presents his reader with incomprehensibly painful and quite literally unbelievable moments of cruelty In one, the boy Binjamin-perhaps a pseudonym for a Jewish child who in 1944 is no more than five or six, and who finds himself separated from his brothers and transported to Majdanek-recalls what happens to two young boys who are caught soiling their already-fouled bunks: They were forbidden to come back into the barracks. …', 'year': 2000}, {'paperId': '742d5bda6ce4ea63b5ea15280caff06a144fb4d0', 'title': 'Disorganizing Experiences in Second- and Third-Generation Holocaust Survivors', 'abstract': 'Second-generation Holocaust survivors might not show direct symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder or attachment disorganization, but are at risk for developing high levels of psychological distress.

Based on in-depth interviews with 196 second-generation parents and their adolescent children, three themes of disorganizing experiences carried across generations were identified: focus on survival issues, lack of emotional resources, and coercion to please the parents and satisfy their needs. These themes reflect the frustration of three basic needs: competence, relatedness, and autonomy, and this frustration becomes disorganizing when it involves stability, potency, incomprehensibility, and helplessness.

The assemblage to be discussed was exhibited in her solo exhibition, One Flesh, in 2020. The corpus analysis will be divided into four themes: (a) The Big Mother – works describing the elderly mother of Nemesh in a monumental manner; (b) Pieta versions – works focusing on bodily scenes of mother and daughter closely tangled; (c) Body-Parts: works showing randomly detached body organs; (d) Domestic Space – the artist's mother in her home.

It was based on structural dissociation theory (O. Van der Hart, E. R. S. Nijenhuis, & K. Steele, 2006), which postulates that when people encounter traumatic events that they cannot integrate into their ongoing mental lives, their personalities may divide into 2 distinct action systems: the apparently normal part of the personality (ANP; involving systems that manage functions of daily life) and the emotional part of the personality (EP; involving systems related to the traumatic memory). Failure to integrate also leads to nonrealization of the traumatic experience. Research participants were 20 people randomly selected from the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's oral history archives. Their interviews were analyzed in terms of structural dissociation and nonrealization in order to develop a narrative about the stages of their post-war lives. In the 1st stage (Surviving the Camps: Formation of Traumatic Memories), the experience of surviving the camps created traumatic emotional memories. In the 2nd stage (Post-War Adjustment: Creating the ANP by Splitting Off the Traumatic Memories Into an EP), survivors' desire to create a normal post-war life led them to split off their traumatic memories. In the 3rd stage (Developing the Motivation to Remember), survivors' changed life context motivated them to confront the previously split-off material.

Although the authorship is unknown, this prisoner\\'s words hold considerable weight. In English, the phrase translates to \"If there is a God, He will have to beg my forgiveness.\" (1) Religious victims of the Holocaust were confronted with the ultimate test of faith. The majority of these victims were the European Jews. Having already been a tormented demographic for thousands of years, they were faced with complete obliteration at the beginning of the Second World War, a time when antisemitism took on its most horrifying form. (2) One of the essential teachings of Judaism is the belief that God is omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent. If God were truly omniscient, or \"all-knowing,\" He surely must have been aware of the imminent death of eleven million human beings, six million of which were his chosen people. If He were really omnipotent, or \"all-powerful,\" He would have been able to stop the atrocities. And, if God were indeed omnibenevolent, or \"all-good,\" how could He have simply stood by while these atrocities occurred? These inconsistencies have given rise to an ongoing philosophical and theological debate among Jewish thinkers. Holocaust theology, a new realm of Jewish philosophy, seeks to explain the behavior and role of God in light of the Shoah. These discussions are composed of religious responses to the problems of suffering and unwarranted evil. Worthwhile engagement in these types of theological arguments requires the consideration of many perspectives, especially of those who were eyewitnesses to the depravity. The survivors of the Holocaust who have graciously supplied their testimonies have concurrently provided various outlets of interpretation concerning the nature, or even existence of God. In his 1980 publication, The Faith and Doubt of Holocaust Survivors, Reeve Brenner, an American Reform rabbi, commented on the importance of survivor testimonial material in field of Jewish studies. In the absence of studies on general Jewish attitudes, the thoughtful and often deeply moving testimonies of survivors provide us with important insights into the nature of Judaism in the post-Holocaust world. And until careful surveys are conducted, survivors will not be speaking for themselves alone: They represent a sensitive barometer of contemporary Jewish beliefs and behavior, not only concerning the Holocaust but on a wide variety of issues. Here is telling proof that the terrible experiences of Auschwitz made victims of the Holocaust acutely aware of the existential condition of man in general and the Jew in particular. (3) With so few survivors left, eyewitness accounts are crucial to keep research in this area alive. In recent decades, the accessibility of survivor testimonies has significantly increased. Shortly after the release of Schindler\\'s List, Steven Spielberg established the Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education at the University of Southern California. The Foundation\\'s Visual History Archive contains 107,000 hours of video documentation of roughly 52,000 eyewitness interviews conducted during the mid to late 1990s. (4) The testimonies used in this paper have been carefully sifted out of this invaluable collection of interviews. Although the personal accounts of survivors are abundant and often quite detailed, anecdotal source material must always be utilized with caution. Indeed, human memory is of better service to anthropological, sociological, and philosophical analysis, rather than historicity. Accordingly, the survivor testimonies in this work will be examined alongside a researched historical narrative. Each man, woman, and child\\'s experience with unrelenting wickedness varies. While some Jewish survivors have discovered a newfound strength in their faith, others have abandoned their beliefs entirely. …', 'year': 2015}, {'paperId': '7816c40178520fdc0b618a7211a6451d5473073c', 'title': 'Issues and Interpersonal Values among Three Generations in Families of Holocaust Survivors', 'abstract': 'This study looks at how three generations in Israeli families of Holocaust survivors work through the past.

The Gulag is typically left out of Western histories of traumatic memory in the twentieth century. Gheith argues that this omission is connected to the silence around the Gulag in Russia and to the fact that the dominant models for traumatic memory are based on the Holocaust, an experience that does not fit for Gulag survivors. Many trauma theorists place narrative (telling the story) at the center of healing from trauma. Yet, for some 50 years after the height of Stalin's purges, Gulag survivors risked severe punishment if they discussed their experiences in the labor camps so that this kind of narrative approach was not open to them. One of the major effects of the enforced silence, Gheith argues, is that absent the narrative option, Gulag survivors developed creative, non-narrative ways to deal with their memories and experiences. Deploying a case study methodology, Gheith argues for the need to include the Gulag in discourse on traumatic memory and to seriously consider modes of healing or repair that are not primarily organized around narrative.\", 'year': 2007}, {'paperId': '786c038c8eecc6653e136a88329daa0f921e8d14', 'title': 'Influences of maternal and paternal PTSD on epigenetic regulation of the glucocorticoid receptor gene in Holocaust survivor offspring.', 'abstract': 'OBJECTIVE\\nDifferential effects of maternal and paternal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been observed in adult offspring of Holocaust survivors in both glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity and vulnerability to psychiatric disorder.

This article examines video archives which document the testimonials of participants in military and political conflicts, with a specific focus on that of the Prisons Memory Archive from Northern Ireland, the Fortunoff Archives of Holocaust survivor testimonies, and their similarities and departures from archives such as Breaking the Silence from Israel/Palestine. Together with more ‘popular’ forms of archiving testimonies of perpetrators and victims, such as Facing the Truth, these archives document many of the incidents and the uncertainties of people involved in the Troubles and those in the Israel Defense Forces. They are not designed as confessionals and yet sometimes they have that quality. The article employs psychoanalytic trauma theories, and their emphasis on the confusions associated with accusation and with confession, to discuss the quality of the confessional in its role as a display of remorse. It then considers both the expectations of confession that arise from any testimonials from participants in conflict, as well as the effect of these expectations in shaping the archive.

Fart I briefly introduces concepts important to Jewish religion and culture while Part Il consists of data from music therapists who work clinically with Jewish people gathered through questionnaires and interviews regarding their uses of music and approaches to religious and cultural matters specific to this minority group. Fart Il also emphasizes practical clinical issues and has implications for clinical practice with a variety of Jewish people and people from other groups in many music therapy settings. A number of years ago, a brief article appeared in a city newspaper describing a music therapy session with older adults. During the group, one member asked the young music therapist to hear Wagner\\'s \"Ride of the Valkyries,\" and she honored the request. As Wagner\\'s music streamed into the room, a woman in the group began to scream. She refused to speak for the next two days. After the session, the music therapist learned that the woman was Jewish and a survivor of the Holocaust in Europe that killed 6 million Jewish people. The Nazis used Wagner\\'s music as a torture device (Moreno, 1999). Although unrealistic to expect mastery of all cultures, this episode exemplifies the need for music therapists in the pluralistic society of the United States to enhance their cultural expertise and to incorporate knowledge and sensitivity regarding different cultures, religions, values, and perspectives into music therapy practice. The purpose of this article is to describe the cultural, religious practices, and music of the Jewish population in the United States and how those influence current practice of music therapy and client responses in music therapy. One of the primary aims is to emphasize the diversity that exists within the broad categorization of clients affiliating with the Jewish religion and culture in order to enhance understanding applicable to appropriate uses of music and to spark insight into considerations when working with clients from other cultures or religious groups.

There are many words associated with the definition of this group, and questions loom about how to utilize these terms (Whitfield, 1999). Disagreement over terms such as \"race,\" \"people,\" \"nation,\" and \"ethnicity\" exists (Levitt & Balkin, 2003; Schlossberger & Hecker, 1998). There is clear acknowledgement of a Jewish religion. There are people who practice \"Judaism.\" People who identify with the culture and customs or follow the religion may consider themselves \"Jewish\" or \"Jews.\" The use of the term \"Jewish\" is not meant to suggest a singular manner in which all of the people encompassed by this label incorporate Jewish religion, background, or culture into their lives. Rather, it can serve as a foundational identifier for this minority group from which further subdivisions and nuances can then be described. How people define their \"Jewishness\" may vary person to person as the Jewish population is not a homogenous group. Demographics. Considering people whose religion is or includes Judaism, have at least one Jewish grandparent, or have a Jewish upbringing, it is reported that there are approximately 5.2 million Jewish people living in the United States, constituting about 1.8% of the country\\'s total population (National Jewish Population Survey, 2003).

It was too late and it was no longer the priority. However, since the war and genocide came to an end, in July 1994, debates have continued to this day about the number of victims claimed by the conflict. Because such a conflict in a then little-known country has been difficult to explain, Rwanda has only garnered global attention due to the figures disseminated by the international media and humanitarian organizations about the scope of the massacres and genocide. Lacking the ability and resolve to end the conflict, the “international community” hastened to send various UN missions to assess the convulsive violence of this “total” war shortly before the complete, lightning victory of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). The RPF, the armed rebel movement of Tutsi refugees who had fled to Uganda, took matters into its own hands by attacking Rwanda on 1 October 1990. During their fieldwork, including interviews with the main players in the conflict, the UN missions documented the slaughter and the specific crimes committed. The battle over the number of war and genocide victims was already raging, not only between the losing and winning sides but also in the international media as well as the diplomatic, political, and intellectual circles affected by this anomalous event. By the end of 1994, the debates had settled on two figures – 500,000 and 2,000,000 – to bookend the number of Tutsi victims (see table below). The UN Commission of Experts used the first figure as its estimate. Supported bymost international experts, it was also based on a 1991 census of the Tutsi population as well as a count of survivors. Because it was based on other UN documents, however, the figure remained under debate: “Overall, hundreds of thousands of people – between 200,000 and 500,000 –were killed throughout the country.

There is some issue to be taken with Jacobs’s sample. She interviewed 60 children and 15 grandchildren of survivors. This is an uneven breakdown, and while Jacobs was open about her sample she did not declare it as a limitation of her study. Likewise, questions might be raised about Jacobs’s methods. She discusses her methodology clearly, but omits any description of coding, or how she arrived at her themes, which would have enriched the discussion that follows. Most particularly, I wanted to know how common each finding was. When, for example, Jacobs spoke about the children and grandchildren who felt pressure to marry other Jews, numbers would have made for a more compelling case. Of the 75 participants in her study, how many felt this way, what made this a ‘common’ finding? This book might also have been strengthened by allowing the reader to ‘get to know’ some of the study participants. Instead of picking several focal descendants that typify the findings and following their responses throughout the chapters with short portraits, we read about an anonymous ‘woman in her sixties’ or a ‘52-year-old participant.’ Despite these gaps, Jacobs makes a significant contribution to the field. She sets out to chart new territory in the ways in which the trauma of genocide is transmitted, to understand better what the effects of genocide are on families, and she does this clearly and with compelling research. She sees her work as a bridge to understanding the effects that other genocides have on the descendants of those that survive, and makes the case that scholars must continue to look at the social structures between survivors and their children and grandchildren, rather than just the psychological ways in which trauma is transmitted.

This study investigated the clinical benefits of a therapeutic process facilitating a detailed videotaped account of traumatic experience (testimony method) in elderly long-term hospitalized Holocaust survivors.\\n\\n\\nMETHOD\\nTwenty-four schizophrenia patients (mean age=72.2 years) who were chronically hospitalized in Israeli state psychiatric hospitals underwent assessment by blind rating with a battery of psychiatric rating scales before and 4 months after extensive videotaped interview. The rating scales included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; Clinical Global Impression (CGI); Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE); Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, Form 2; and Structured Interview for Disorders of Extreme Stress. Full pre- and postinterview data were available for 21 patients.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nThirty-eight percent of the patients met the criteria for PTSD at the first interview, compared with only 19% at the second interview. The patients had significant reductions in functional impairment and in the severity and intensity of all posttraumatic symptom clusters (intrusion, avoidance, hyperarousal); the avoidance cluster showed the most reduction. Eleven subjects had an improvement of 30% or more in total posttraumatic severity score. No differences in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, MMSE, Structured Interview for Disorders of Extreme Stress, and CGI total scores were noted postinterview or between the two preinterview evaluation batteries in the comparison group. Female patients had a higher prevalence of PTSD symptoms. Total Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, Form 2, scores and total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores were inversely correlated both at baseline and at follow-up.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nStudy observations suggest clinical benefits of the testimony method in the alleviation of many posttraumatic symptoms, but not psychosis, in a cohort of psychiatrically ill Holocaust survivors, despite an interval of as many as 60 years since the traumatic events.

This has been the center of the a-integrative theory of aging demonstrating an attitude to life based on cognitive and emotional dimensions. Aging of Holocaust survivors (HS) is especially difficult when focus is brought to the issue of integrating their life history. The present study aimed to investigate the interplay between psychache and resilience amongst aging HS. Methods: Cross-sectional study of HS and a matched comparison group recruited from the general population was carried out. All underwent a personal interview and endorsed quantifiable psychache and resilience scales. Results: We enrolled 214 elderly participants: 107 HS and 107 comparison participants. Mean age for the participants was 80.7± years; there were 101 women and 113 men in each group. Holocaust survivors did not differ in the level of resilience from comparisons (mean: 5.82 ± 0.68 vs. 5.88 ± 0.55, respectively).

At its centre, Langer’s body of work over five decades emphasizes the anti-redemptive experiences and ‘choiceless choices’ of those who survived the Holocaust. He underscores how testimony can begin to reveal what life was like for witnesses under circumstances that systematically undermined moral and ethical values. Rather than imposing heroic or healing narratives on testimonies, his analytical approach is directed towards training our eyes and ears to how witnesses express the anguished, humiliated, and shattered aspects of their experiences. While it is impossible for anyone other than a survivor to fully comprehend what he or she went through, Langer makes the compelling case that interviewers and audiences are nonetheless obliged to try to understand survivors, all the while acknowledging the impossibility of doing so. In that sense, Langer foregrounds the paradoxical nature of giving and receiving testimonies. He advocates for modes of intimately conducting and interpreting testimonies with witnesses without being appropriative of their experiences; while deeply invested in receiving the testimonies of others, he nonetheless recognizes the experiential rift that separates witnesses from those who bear witness to their recollections. This essay foregrounds the importance of Langer’s explorations of the lacunae and tensions that mark testimonies, particularly as they manifest in the interplay between ‘common memory’ and ‘deep memory.’ Langer’s analysis of that dynamic profoundly shapes not only the ways we document and interpret testimonies of the Holocaust, but also those of other genocides.', 'year': 2020}, {'paperId': '822eb56bc52f5b93ea50cf1f94b323b205492321', 'title': 'Epistemic competitions over Jewish Holocaust survivors’ stories in interviews', 'abstract': 'In this article, we scrutinise epistemic competitions in interviews about World War II.

On the one hand, the analyses illustrate how the interviewers rely on their historical expert status – as evidenced through their specialist knowledge and ventriloquisation of vicarious WWII narratives – in order to topicalise certain master narratives and thereby attempt to project particular identities upon the interviewees. On the other hand, the interviewees derive their epistemic authority from their first-hand experience as Jewish Holocaust survivors, on which they draw in order to counter these story projections, whilst constructing a more distinct self-positioning to protect their nuanced personal identity work.

Jane Schapiro is a freelance writer and poet who lives in the Washington area. During the late 1990s she gained access to one of the legal teams that brought a class action against Swiss banks accused of pocketing the \"dormant\" accounts of Jews who perished at the hands of the Nazis and profiting from slave labor and transactions that helped the Third Reich wage war and genocide. To reconstruct the class action she draws on congressional hearings, court transcripts, and documents collected for the case as well as interviews with several lawyers on both sides. Some lawyers, especially in Switzerland, declined to assist her; others preferred to remain anonymous. Her chief informant was Michael Hausfeld, and this book is very much his tale. It is not a rounded account of the furor that engulfed Switzerland in 1995-2000. Although Schapiro deftly sketches in the background, key players such as Stuart Eizenstat do not appear until midway through the saga. We learn a lot about Hausfeld\\'s emotional gyrations, but little about the state of mind of Ed Fagan, who assembled the other major legal team in the action. Schapiro presents a sympathetic portrait of Hausfeld, whom Eizenstat describes as \"unpredictable and at times unreasonable.\" Hausfeld had an impressive record of litigating against big corporations and was sensitized to Nazi-era issues. The plight of elderly survivors rebuffed by implacable bankers enraged him, and he was prepared to work pro bono to help them achieve justice. But he had wider ambitions, too. He wanted to prove that Swiss banks had knowingly benefited from genocide and helped to prolong the war. Hausfeld was beaten to the court room by Ed Fagan, who filed a similar class action, although more narrowly focused. Fagan and Hausfeld eventually joined forces, but it was a fractious relationship. Hausfeld disliked Fagan\\'s flamboyant style. Fagan suspected that Hausfeld was content to litigate endlessly because he didn\\'t have to worry about collecting fees. Hausfeld wanted to prove that Switzerland violated \"customary international law,\" while Fagan had far more limited objectives. Hausfeld was prepared to work with the WJC, while Fagan feared it wanted to monopolize the distribution of any court settlement. It was not without reason that Eizenstat described the lawyers\\' joint team as \"a witches brew of egos and mutual jealousies.\" Schapiro explains how Hausfeld and his colleagues built their case, and she is frank about its weaknesses. For all the labor of researchers in the National Archives the lawyers for the plaintiffs had no idea how many \"dormant\" accounts there might be. Nor could they prove how much wealth actually flowed into Switzerland as a result of Nazi looting, the exploitation of slave labor, and profits on wartime transactions. The connections between Swiss banks and slave labor were tenuous. Under pressure from the WJC the banks conceded an independent audit, but its chairman, Paul Volcker, refused to share its findings with the class action lawyers. They might obtain documents via the process of \"discovery,\" but only if Judge Edward Korman, appointed to hear the case, let it go to trial. …', 'year': 2005}, {'paperId': '85005ac53a7e4dc9a160066df9d918f3bb6aabfe', 'title': 'CHILDREN IN GENOCIDE EXTREME TRAUMATIZATION AND AFFECT REGULATION', 'abstract': 'Reaching retirement, war children those who were children during the Second World War have begun to look back and are now finally trying to work through their experiences.

He not only explains who they were and what they were ordered to do in Auschwitz-Birkenau but also discusses the reception of this phenomenon in postwar Israeli society, in the historiography of the Holocaust, and in the historical memory of survivors. Then Polian turns to the evidence left by those members of Sonderkommando who survived the war (110 men out of, roughly, 2,200): some of them wrote memoirs, while others gave detailed interviews. However, there was evidence bequeathed by those Sonderkommandos who perished.

The ten Auschwitz \"scrolls\" by five authors, all members of Sonderkommando, represent central documents of the Holocaust.

The analysis of data collected uses the methodology of triangulation: a merge of qualitative and quantitative methods. The following results were obtained: -a parent's traumatic experience has a detrimental effect on the process of separation and individualisation of progeny, and results in individual psychopathologies. This is particularly plain in the case of daughters. -evidence was found for a relationship between the occurrences of psychopathologies in a traumatised parent and in a child. An untraumatised parent seems to have more significance by performing a protective role; the subjects' generational families were often combative; emotional neglect experienced in childhood seems a key impact that makes transgenerational transmission more acute. -the observed differences between the clinical group and the non-clinical one do not appear big. -the proportion of subjects who take up a search and actively engage in the building of their identity corresponds to population data; a higher level of ethnic identity does not correlate with psychic well-being.

For four years, I (Carolyn) have met with Jerry Rawicki; for three years, I (Chris) have held conversations with Sal Wainberg (until his death, February 22, 2012). Initially Carolyn conducted traditional oral history interviews with Sal and Jerry, which provided a concentrated chronology of the survivors\\' experiences before, during, and after the Holocaust. This information proved an invaluable foundation for us as we continued with more interactional meetings that fol- lowed the trajectory of survivors\\' current lives. In these conversations, we paid attention to how \"then\" (the Holocaust) plays into their experiences \"now\" (later in life) and how \"now\" relates to restorying \"then.\" Through compassionate conversations we provided an opportunity for Jerry and Sal to tell their past and current stories in multiple and new ways. In the process, we discovered new plotlines and insights together.We also reflected with Jerry and Sal on the meaningful and collaborative relationship we were developing. Though our focus was on them, we shared our vulnerable stories, learning from them about ourselves, and becoming more supportive as our conversations deepened. As collaborative researchers, we (Chris and Carolyn) also stayed in conversation with each other about how to work compassionately with participants (Patti, \"Sharing\" ). How could we build relationships with those we interviewed, be present in their lives when they had troubles, and feel we were making a difference by passing on their stories?Our work follows the principles expressed and demonstrated by Bud Goodall and Nick Trujillo, who made a case for research that tells stories about everyday practices and individual and collective meanings (Goodall, \"Writing\"; Pacanowsky and O\\'Donnell-Trujillo). Both wrote compassionate and vulnera- ble stories about illness, grief, love, and loss. Their exemplary stories included Goodall\\'s blog about living and dying as well as he could with pancreatic cancer (\"The Daily Narrative\") and Trujillo\\'s book with his wife about coping with her illness and death from ovarian cancer (Vande Berg and Trujillo). For Bud and Nick, research should embrace the mysteries of life and focus on what Goodall (\"Writing\" 63) calls \"human stories,\" rather than turn subjects into objects. They were not afraid to take risks or to \"ask the big questions about life,\" linking them to how we \"can understand [our lives] in this cosmos, on this blue planet, a bit better\" (Goodall, \"Writing\" 187). In their research, they took into account the social and dialogical nature of communication and our connections with events and persons we study. Their stories of love and loss, written with humility and heart, provided access to their experiences so that we might call on them as companions as we try to work through our own struggles with more grace, dignity, and humanity. They believed, as do we, that research should contribute to making the world a better place, even through relatively small acts in the everyday worlds in which we cohabit.After presenting our participants, we introduce compassionate listening and then enter the heart of our work, two stories about our interactions with Sal and Jerry. These stories demonstrate the intimacy of our relationships as we focus on the situations these two survivors find themselves in at this later stage of life-for Jerry, grief over losing his wife; for Sal, his cancer and desire to be listened to at the end of life. After the stories, we construct a conversation that grapples with what we learned about compassionate interviewing, our relationships with Jerry and Sal, and the reciprocal impact of the Holocaust and compassionate storytelling.The ParticipantsSal Wainberg was almost four years old when Germany invaded his shtetl of ? …', 'year': 2014}, {'paperId': '87784b204344954594a9f111440aac780e286eab', 'title': 'Jews in Germany after the Holocaust: Memory, Identity, and Jewish German Relations, by Lynn Rapaport', 'abstract': \"Jews in Germany after the Holocaust: Memory, Identity, and Jewish German Relations, by Lynn RapaportA few years back I received a DAAD grant to do research in Germany. I told an older colleague the news and his reaction surprised me. He said that I could take such a grant, I was young enough, but he couldn't take money from Germans or spend a year in Germany. The reason for the difference in our attitudes was the Holocaust. For him, it was an event of first-hand experience, whereas for me it was inevitably history.This story is relevant, since the difference in attitudes of two generations frames the subject of this book, which focuses its attention on the views of Germany, Germans, and Jewry in Germany of second-generation Jews, i.e., children of survivors. From interviews carried out by Ms. Rapaport, we find a similar pattern. The parents, who experienced the Holocaust and are now in their sixties and seventies, have a more restrictive conception of relations between Jews and Germans. They do not want their children to socialize with Germans, preferring their children to take Jewish spouses and bring up Jewish children. Nevertheless, the majority of young adult Jews living in Germany have friendships with Germans and interact with them extensively, often intermarrying.Despite the dramatic title, which evokes stirrings of anxiety and consternation -- Jews, Germany, Holocaust -- the issues brought up here are actually mundane. One reads the testimony of a man who wonders if he got good grades in school because he was a Jew (p. 114), a man who bickers with his parents over going out with non-Jewish girls (p. 210), and a woman who feels embarrassed about her Jewishness in front of strangers (p. 181).The narrative gets a wee bit racier with the statement of a Jewish man who found out his girlfriend's father was in the SS, and the viewpoint of a Jewish girl who prefers non-Jewish guys for sex (p. 229). Outside of these unusual testimonies, the vast majority tell a repetitive story: parents do not approve of socializing with non-Jews; young Jews, despite their successful entrance into German life, harbor feelings of alienation, feel uncomfortable with German citizenship, and desire Jewish spouses.The rigor of the author -- interviews with 84 individuals in 1984 and reinterviewing in 1994 -- is praiseworthy. Although she apparently tried to elicit controversial subjects, again and again the interviewees return to issues from their daily life. Thus, instead of a problematic, dangerous, and diseased society in which neo-Nazis run amok or Germans humiliate their Jewish neighbors, we see a sanguine picture of normality. We are introduced to very nice people facing the uneventful problems of living as a national minority in a very rich but ethnically homogenized land. Furthermore, this book seems to show that the denazification of West Germany (the interviewees are from Frankfurt) enjoyed success; most of the stories about German colleagues and friends reflect positive values -- condemnation of German aggression, guilt for the Holocaust, and a healthy tolerance of Jews. …\", 'year': 1999}, {'paperId': '88ba24f0a746ea355c6d4581c79dc1c5c004b30a', 'title': '“And the Ones that Survived had Hope”: Resilience in Holocaust Survivors', 'abstract': 'The current study uses a strengths-based lens to explore the resilience narratives of five Holocaust survivors and their perspectives on experiences of resilience during and after the Holocaust.

Drawing inspiration and ideas from the works of psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl, Dr. Breitbart and his fellow, Dr. Mindy Greenstein, designed an 8-week, group-focused, manualized course of experiential exercises, which is being compared to an 8-week, manualized cancer support group intervention, to see how well meaning-focused care can address a constellation of constructs that he and his colleagues are calling “despair at the end of life.” The component constructs of despair at the end of life include hopelessness, depression, loss of meaning, suicidal ideation, and desire for hastened death.

Similarly, the conventional “testimony” model limits the extent to which we are likely to become engaged in, and implicated by, survivors’ retelling. I have been making those arguments for over forty years. Here, the focus is primarily on teaching “beyond testimony”: especially through immersion in survivors’ recounting as a deliberate, situated, multiply contingent process in which students themselves become, in a survivors’ phrase, “participants in a conversation.” In my classroom, collaborative exploration—that is, participation in conversation — replaces “receiving a testimony” as the guiding paradigm. Students’ responses to such conversations are featured. One student wrote about a survivor who visited the class: “She was not ‘just a survivor, if I can say it that way. And that made her being a survivor much more significant. The ‘not- survivor’ part of her—the experiences and traits that are just like us or people we know—is what made the ‘survivor part’ real. Not a symbol of the Holocaust.

What is even more striking, being more personal, is the inner reflection of this gradual development, the always subsequent interpretation and explanation of one’s own life experiences. It is a real art to know how to bring to light the consistency of an inner life. In the book of interviews called Nicolae Kallós, Crîmpei de viaþã din secolul XX. Un dialog despre evreitate, holocaust oi comunsim ca experienþe personale [Nicolae Kallós: A dialogue on Jewish identity, Holocaust, and Communism as personal Experiences], Sandu Frunzã has proved his rhetorical art in revealing the relevancy of subjective opinions. This relevancy consists in the fact that the idea of identity involves a continuous “rapport à soi” that unfolds two main characteristics of one’s identity: on the one hand, reflexivity, a certain disclosure of an image of one’s self, and on the other hand, an endless search of a peculiar, always new and differentiated system of values. Employing these principles in his discussions with Nicolae Kallós, now a consultant professor and a PhD. supervisor at the Babeo-Bolyai University from Cluj and the author, among others, of books like: The Political Consciousness (1968), Sociology, Politics, Ideology (1975), and Politics as science (1975), Frunzã has succeeded in vividly portraying the conducive principle of the life of the intellectual Nicolae Kallós, who has experienced Holocaust, communism, and transition to a democratic society. Regarding his experiences, Kallós states, “I have consciously tried ... to cultivate and to ‘keep measure’ in life, in behavior, and in the intellectual exercises. To keep measure is, in my opinion, a hypostasis of normality. I have tried – I repeat: with eyes open – to keep myself normal in a mad world, in the mad worlds of the XXth Century, not to lose measure of things in a world of all kinds of excessiveness.” Due to the art of questioning, and doubtless due to the sincerity and openness that characterizes the answers of Frunzã’s partner of dialogue, this book represents the best example of transcending the methodological shortcomings of an approach rather pertaining to the field of Oral History. Compared to a more scientific statistical approach, any approach of Oral History could be easily accused of being subjective and of not having objective relevance to an entire community. After reading such a book, which reveals historic truth through the raw example of a life experience, one comes to believe that the words of a survivor of the Nazi concentration camps are emblematic at least of the community from which he came from. A central idea consistently discussed in the interview is that of the relation between belief and Jewishness. Regarding this issue, Kallós draws out the changes that have supervened once with the experience of Holocaust in the identity of the Jewish community of Transylvania.

Together and Apart in Brzezany: Poles, Jews, and Ukrainians, 1919-1945. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2002. xix, 202 pp. Maps. Illustrations. Notes. Bibliography. Index. Cloth.Before the second World War Brzezany, then in eastern Poland now in western Ukraine, resembled many medium-sized towns in the region. Poles and Jews made up nearly eighty percent of the total population but the surrounding countryside was predominantly Ukrainian, and Ukrainians increasingly migrated into the town. The newly-resurrected Poland of the interwar period favored ethnic Poles but also allowed its non-Polish citizens-around a third of the total population-a certain degree of cultural and autonomy. During this period, however, xenophobic and antisemitic streams within the Polish population and government gained strength. Such is the background of Shimon Redlich\\'s memorable account-part history and part memoir-of interethnic relations in Brzezany between the two world wars.As Redlich makes clear from the start, this book differs radically in scope and approach from his previous works. Historians will know Redlich\\'s respected work on the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee in the USSR during World War II. The book under review, however, is a much more personal document. Redlich was born in Brzezany in 1935 and begins the book with an account of his return to the now Ukrainian town of Berezhany in 1991. Throughout, personal memories and interviews with survivors-Polish, Ukrainian, and Jewish-from that period are interspersed with more impersonal-some would say \"objective\"-historical data, creating a unique and compelling narrative of that time and place. Redlich, who recalls \"growing up in Polish,\" survived the Holocaust with help from Ukrainians, and has now lived a half-century in Israel, is perhaps uniquely capable of appreciating and reporting dispassionately the different attitudes and behaviors of the three ethnic groups of his native town. Unlike some of his interviewees who remark, for example, that all Poles were antisemites, Redlich manages to portray both vivid individual portraits and plausible reconstructions of events, including the most terrible ones. Obviously a work that touches on issues of mass murder cannot avoid moral questions, nor does Redlich pretend to be an \"objective observer\" at all moments. But he retains throughout a higher kind of objectivity, one which allows him to discuss motivations-even unsavory ones-with nuance, and appreciation for both positive and negative aspects of human behavior, all the while avoiding cheap moralizing or ethnic stereotyping. …', 'year': 2002}, {'paperId': '8b647ab3b9e4ce58420b63f8ad4d037d231e5688', 'title': 'The Unsaid, the Incommunicable, the Unbearable, and the Irretrievable', 'abstract': 'Abstract Drawing on forty years of interviewing Holocaust survivors—in most cases, multiple interviews with the same survivors over months, years, even decades—this article elucidates the range and complexity of different kinds of silence in survivors’ spoken accounts.

It won the Discovery Award from the Hollywood Film Festival Award and the German Unions\\' (DAG) Gold Prize for the best television movie Amidst a backdrop of news footage from real incidents in that turbulent period, Targownik tells the story of two sons of Holocaust survivors living in Germany. Michael Rosenzweig, a laborer engaged to a Vietnamese woman, randomly fires shots at a rampaging mob of skinheads when they attack and set fire to the refugee shelter where his fiancee lives. That night a prominent neo-Nazi leader is assassinated in the same neighborhood. The bullets in his body are traced to Michael\\'s gun. Michael\\'s brother Jacob reluctantly becomes his brother\\'s lawyer when he suspects that the court-appointed public defender Ahrendt has the wrong strategy. Jacob tracks down a homeless man who witnessed a skinhead pick up Michael\\'s gun after he tossed it away. Although Michael is cleared of homicide and marries, skinheads burn down his parents\\' apartment. Targownik admittedly \"looks at German events from a Jewish perspective.\" While she plans to return to Germany to make other films, she resides in Israel, where she completed her Masters degree in Jewish Philosophy at Tel Aviv University. Rosenzweig\\'s Freedom is distributed in the United States by the National Center for Jewish Film, ncjf@brandeis.edu. LB: You were raised in Germany. When you were growing up, what films about Jewish life or the Holocaust had an impact on you? LT: I do not remember having seen a film about Jewish life or the Holocaust made by a German filmmaker when I was young. I think the first one I ever saw was The Sound of Music. I was about six years old and remember a nice and happy film that suddenly switched to the scene when the family has to flee across the mountains to evade being captured by the Nazis. It was very scary. The first film about Jewish life that I saw was Hester Street by Joan Micklin-Silver. I remember seeing it in Munich with my family and other people from the Jewish community. Everybody was very moved and proud that there was a film about \"us.\" There were only 5,000 Jews in Munich out of a total population of 1.5 million. Everyone knew each other. I was confronted with the issue of the Holocaust through books rather than films. My parents gave me The Diary of Anne Frank and the books of Leon Uris. I saw the movie versions of The Diary and Exodus after I had read the books. I saw a stage production of Fiddler on the Roof before I watched the film. LB: I noticed that one of your first films was about Aktionsuhnenzeichen, a group of young Germans who undertake various projects to help the victims of Nazi Germany. What attracted you to this topic? LT: This documentary was my first work for Israeli TV. I did not speak Hebrew yet, but the head of the program Mabat Sheni, Michael Karpin, wanted me to do a film on this topic. I filmed young Germans working in Israel, trying to cope with the German past by helping Jews and Arabs there. LB: You are now studying in Israel. Have you made Aliyah or do you plan to return to Germany to make films about Jewish subjects? LT: I made Aliyah years ago. I make films both in Germany and Israel. This is a small world, you know. Of course, Rosenzweig\\'s Freedom was shot and produced in Germany. I am now planning a feature film called H.O.M.E. that will be set in Jerusalem in 2000. It will be done in English. I am also planning a documentary in Israel.

The premise of the research – that there are meanings outside of the photographic frame – follows notions of – Barthes’ ‘punctum’ (Barthes, 1982), Hirsch’s ‘postmemory-work’ (Hirsch, 2012) and Langford’s ‘oral-photographic framework’ (Langford, 2008). I use the term confabulation to nominate the combination of two significant aspects of storytelling: the act of ‘going beyond the photographic frame’ and the act of filling in missing narrative-memory gaps with new meanings. My hypothesis is that confabulation, through conversation around photographs, gains access to the performative-interactive-register of family photographs; it reveals shadow archives and catalyses their content, that act as counter-memory. The research also engages with Vilem Flusser’s theory (Flusser, 2000), suggesting that confabulated counter-narratives are tools, which work against the programme of the photographic apparatus. The research asks how does confabulation, through affecting reading and editing, excavate the private content of family photographs from shadow-archives and transform it to counter-memories? \\n \\nIn 1945 the Soviet army liberated Hungary and stopped the Nazi deportations and executions; simultaneously the communist regime socialised properties and kept citizens under control by the Secret Police. Deportation and murder continued, leading to further ruptures in the socio-cultural environment, which divided national-cultural memory. The 20th century Hungarian historical context is a fertile ground for case studies, as all ethnicities of the population suffered significant trauma. Due to state-directed forced remembering and forgetting, losses stayed unprocessed. These \\nmaintain their presence, dominate private memories through generations in forms of resurfacing traumas or active silencing – manifesting as gaps. \\n \\nIn the research, I adopt two positions to capture confabulation; the autoethnographic and the archivist-editor. \\n \\nIn my personal, autoethnographic inquiry, I question the intentions behind my family’s silenced narratives of both Holocaust survivor and communist perpetrator pasts. The process of excavation includes facing limitations, which I aim to translate. From the material re-enactment, I learn that erasure is a perpetual, un-achievable, act. The visual outputs encrypt such experiences. The pocket-sized books enable the viewers for an active, performed engagement through which they simultaneously experience the obsessive attempts of filling in the gaps to reconstruct – moving the objects to peek into holes – and failure through material resistance. \\n \\nThrough the archivist-editor practice I foreground other people’s subjectivity. To collect confabulated stories on photographs, I combined oral history methods, open-ended insider interviews with autoethnographical methods of ‘collaborative witness’ (Ellis, Rawicki, 2013) and ‘friendship as method’ (Tillmann-Healy, 2003). From such an internal position, I accompany the eight participants – my friends – in their idiosyncratic meaning making, where I performed as the audience for the storyteller. Through insider participation, I analysed our interaction, mapped and visualised our encounter, expanding Langford’s’ oral-photographic framework, creating family album-like photobooks in both digital and material form. Moving to the collective level, I also mapped and visualised how Hungarian ideological frameworks weave into the participants’ personal network and how do these correspond with each other as memory texts (Kuhn, 2002). This methodology revealed that confabulated narratives deviate from the participant’s pre-set narrative frameworks. \\n \\nI argue that the oral-performative-interactive register of photographs is accessible through confabulation. The viewer, interacting with the listener, transforms into a storyteller, draws the emotional narrative around the gaps – the denied and silences past – which creates a presence for it – that eventually can be recovered and reconciled. Through the confabulative process, the participants inscribe their own subjective voice, gain ownership of their past, which subsequently renders their narratives counter to the dominant Hungarian ideological frameworks.', 'year': 2020}, {'paperId': '8fcdd24547427364ae9d607300b005db608ebaf1', 'title': 'Narrating survival: Dina Gottliebova in conversation with Hilary Helstein', 'abstract': \"ABSTRACT In this article the authors analyze the Shoah Foundation’s video testimony of the Holocaust survivor Dina Gottliebova (1923–2009).

Mening, minne, kompromettering', 'abstract': 'This thesis examines the representation in visual culture of the Holocaust, the Nazi genocide of European Jewry. It is divided into three main parts, each one focusing on a particular aspect of Holocaust representation. Part 1, \"Meaning\" (chapter 1-3), begins by considering the important role played by documentary photographs from the concentration camps for the public knowledge and conception of the Holocaust. The thesis then proceeds to study the work and reception of five artists, between 1945 and 1998, who have used these atrocity photos as a basis for their art: Corrado Cagli, Gerhart Frankl, Rico Lebrun, Boris Lurie and Robert Morris. In some of them, the motive of the mass grave is found to take on new cultural meanings through the passage from documentary- to artistic image. In others, the atrocity imagery instead undermines the conventions of meaning in art. The author proposes the theory of abject and abjection, by the French-Rumanian psychoanalyst Julia Kristeva, as an interpretational model of these negotiations between the motif of the mass grave and visual culture.\\n\\nPart 2,\"Memory\" (chapter 4-5), first considers the visualisation of Holocaust memory in the forms of video interviews with Holocaust survivors, Holocaust monuments (Buchenwald and Berlin), and photographs of Jewish life before and during the Holocaust. These are analysed with regard to different understandings of Holocaust memory as either \"traumatic\" or \"constructed\", borrowed from historiography. The thesis then proceeds to examine Holocaust memory in digital media, such as the Internet and CD-rom, in which the technology seems to foster ideas about memory as programmable and re-programmable. The author detects a shift from \"historical\" to \"virtual\" Holocaust memory, when the interactive features of digital media are combined with a pedagogy that stresses empathetic insight and identification. Clashes between competing collective memories over official Holocaust monuments are contrasted to the simultaneous individualisation and universalisation of Holocaust memory in the new media.\\n\\nPart 3, \"Incrimination\" (chapter 6-8), examines the visual representation of Nazism and forms an antipole to the focus on processes of meaning and identification in the previous parts of the book. \"Incrimination\" is here understood as a kind of cultural, negative signification of a secondary order, a \"counter-meaning\" always consisting of the destruction of a pre-existing positive meaning or identity. From this perspective, the author discusses various forms of the visualisation of Nazism, including some adopted by the Nazi regime itself as well as today’s post-modern appropriations of the aesthetics and iconography of Nazism. From the conflict within Nazism over German Expressionism to the censoring of contemporary artists like Melvin Charney, Zbigniew Libera and Ronald Jones from international exhibitions, this study points to the problems involved in visually defining Nazism and its ties to both European cultural traditions and to modernity.', 'year': 2002}, {'paperId': '92ba579aa87d2419dc3d3b8835e87018ba21b85b', 'title': 'Forty years later: long-term consequences of massive traumatization as manifested by Holocaust survivors from the city and the Kibbutz.', 'abstract': \"The present study explored the differences between male and female Holocaust survivors (n = 34) and controls (n = 34) who were similar to the survivors but had not been victims of the Holocaust.

Survivors were worse off psychologically than comparison individuals on the quality of emotional life, on emotional expression, and on the quality of interpersonal relations. Also, survivors assigned relatively greater value to their postwar families. City survivors seem to be worse off than Kibbutz survivors, and male survivors from the city had the lowest scores on several key subscales.

One of those interviewed, Adnan Abbas, recounted that he had been asked: “‘Hasn’t Iraq had enough war, enough bad things? Why not make something bright?’” His response was appropriate: “‘Misery is part of humanity, especially here. How can anyone miss that?’” The New York Times story was not about genocide, but the ugly consequences of war and the need for artists to depict and witness by painting in less than ideal conditions. This response is nothing new, although the plastic arts when connected to genocide, except for art created during the Holocaust, have had a low profile. The reasons for this are imprecise. Certainly, however, many writers and scholars feel ill-equipped to deal with the subject and are content to deal with the photographic and film/video records, which have their own power and what might be termed “authenticity.” Until the age of computer manipulation, it was thought that the camera lens did not lie. Now, however, we are not so certain. Thus, it seems logical to think about how the artistic vision has given us an impression of atrocities and genocidal events. Atrocity has been depicted often in the visual arts over the past centuries. There is an impressive record of such work, from the Disasters of War series by the Spanish artist Goya to Picasso’s Guernica, to recent art dealing with politically charged subjects. More important is what art about genocide looks like and how should it be used. The images may not be so obvious. For those who have familiarity with the wealth of artistic resources that emerged from the Holocaust, the material base for other genocides may seem paltry. The artistic legacy can come from many quarters: outsiders warning about genocide or massacres in posters; images by survivors which include children’s art done after the end of genocide; imaginative and what may be called “post-modern” art made under the worst circumstances, such as during the siege of Sarajevo, in order to convey a specific message about art and artists trying to send a message to the Journal of Genocide Research (2005), 7(1), March, 31–46', 'year': 2005}, {'paperId': '933631150978944a582bff5a1f2d7e129931805c', 'title': 'The Unrighteous Righteous and the Righteous Unrighteous', 'abstract': 'This analysis of several hundred accounts by Jewish survivors of the Holocaust in Poland and by Poles who helped them survive offers a nuanced picture of Jewish-Polish relations during and after World War II.

Renov\\'s essay is also an occasion to compare the practices of film and video production in works that look to the same contested geographical region. I propose to direct Renov\\'s thinking toward Ravctt/s more recent film, The March (1999), which invites comparison with Lebanese-Canadian video artist Jayce Salloum\\'s video unfilled part I: everything and nothing (1999/2002). Each work features a woman witness, and each presents us with material for an archive of documents on the Middle East. In The March Ravelt edits together footage of his mother shot over a number of years using syne-sound filmmaking equipment. He makes the same request of her every lime he shoots, namely that she relate her experience of a march under the watch of Nazi soldiers. In untitled part I: everything and nothing, Salloum shoots a single-take interview on video with Soha Bechara, a young-woman who has recently been released from an Israeli detention center. The video is edited down to forty minutes and the subject\\'s statements translated into English subtitles. Each work takes an experimental approach to documentary by approaching the record of testimony with some caution. Before I take up die works at issue in this essay, I want to make a few observations about Ravett\\'s film on his father that drew Renov\\'s attention. Here we can initiate reflection on the concept of a witness. In the film, the filmmaker\\'s own relationship with his wife and children provokes him to ask questions of his father about a wife and children his father lost during the Holocaust. Everything \\'v For You stages familial encounters that invite comparison with the biblical and Talmudic story of the binding of Isaac. For example, the filmmaker shares his first name with the Jewish patriarch who attempted to fulfill God\\'s command lo sacrifice his son Isaac on Mount Moriah. This story has fueled extensive philosophical reflection on responsibility, most notably by French philosopher Jacques Derrida in The Gift of Death (1095). For Derrida, responsibility is a matter of responding to the Other within the religions of the book (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), all of which share the figure of Abraham/Ibrahim. In the biblical story Abraham answers God\\'s call but can only accept responsibility by acting irresponsibly before mankind. \"He acts as if he were discharged of his duty toward his fellows, his son. and humankind.\" Derrida writes, \"but he continues to love them. He must love them,.. and also owe them everything in order to sacrifice them (2) For Derrida the paradox of loving those toward which one is acting in an immoral manner cannot bo remedied. It makes no sense to bring Abraham before a human tribunal. because the call is precisely to respond to a command to behave in a reprehensible way. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] How is all of this related to the concept of a witness? Abraham feels himself absolved of his duty before men and does not attempt to explain himself or tell his secret. This secrecy, Derrida suggests, belongs to the experience of the witness. Abraham is a witness to \"an absolute relation with the absolute, but he doesn\\'t witness to it in the sense that to witness means to show, teach, illustrate, [or] manifest to others the truth that one can precisely attest to.\" (3) This particular concept of the witness, however, does not adequately give us the sense in which Ravett\\'.s mother, Fela, might be a witness in The March not only because she is a woman, but because the question she is repeatedly asked over the course of the years the film spans concerns a death march endured as an individual rather than the sacrifice of a familv member. …', 'year': 2012}, {'paperId': '946716adcb0c5aef3c658d1d4a87b71e93b56483', 'title': \"The transmutation of testimony in Cling, Najman and Finkiel's Aftermath films\", 'abstract': \"Abstract During this last decade a large number of testimonial films, dedicated to the survivors of the Shoah, have been prompted by the same urge: the revisionist and negationist schemes regarding the Holocaust and the vulnerable state of the aging eyewitness.

Since then, many volumes have been published which feature collections of Reb Shlomo\\'s inspirational stories, commentary on the Torah, etc. Dr. Natan Ophir\\'s ambitious biography of Carlebach is the first attempt to present the story of Carlebach rather than the stories. As Dr. Ophir puts forth in the preface, his goal is \"to compose what is called a \\'critical biography.\\' As opposed to subjective and interpretive biographies, this genre entails meticulous research, detailed footnotes, and scholarly annotations in order to piece together dates, names, and places. The aim is to evaluate the life of the subject by setting forth minutiae that become meaningful through the prism of the historical backdrop and the colorfulness of the cultural settings\" (13). Having said that, Ophir soon admits his own personal connection to Carlebach and the struggle he encountered to be objective in his writing.To understand Shlomo Carlebach\\'s development and impact, it is necessary to examine the cultural shifts which were taking place during the second half of the 20Ih century in both secular and Jewish circles. Ophir does an admirable job of describing the changing face of Jewish youth in America; the many disenfranchised children of holocaust survivors who were searching for meaning that they were unable to find in Judaism. Through personal interviews, Ophir chronicles many stories of Jewish youth who were seeking for answers in Middle Eastern religions and who were brought back to Judaism by Carlebach\\'s warmth, unconditional love and acceptance, and version of Jewish practice and ritual. Ophir also brielfy profiles Yogi Bhajan, Sufi Sam, and Swami Satchidananda, three gurus with whom Carlebach was \\'competing\\' for the Jewish souls. Perhaps Carlebach\\'s message was most realized in the formation of his \\'House of Love and Prayer\\' in San Francisco in the late sixties and early seventies where the \\'holy beggars\\' found a place to rediscover their roots.Ophir divides the book into independent sections with self contained chronologies. For instance, chapter eight discusses Carlebach\\'s relationship with Israel between 1959-1994, while chapter nine discusses his work on behalf of Soviet Jewry and his travels to Eastern Europe and Russia between the years 1965-1989. The isolation of topics makes them more convenient to understand individually.

It demonstrates that their texts comprise fictional meditations on the meaning of testimony, and are concerned with the ways in which narrators and readers of testimonies remember and imagine the Holocaust. The introduction outlines the key thematic, formal and theoretical concerns of the thesis within their academic context. It proposes that a self-reflexive awareness of the subjectivity and constructedness of Holocaust representation in fiction provides insight into valuable and necessary processes of the imagination. Four chapters examine different approaches to the imagination. The first interprets Norma Rosen's Touching Evil through her notion of witness-through-the-imagination. Drawing on concepts such as empathy, identification, secondary trauma and the addressee, it explores the meaning of Holocaust testimony for the reader. The second considers the subjectivity of memory by comparing the testimonies and memories of the traumatised survivor protagonists in the historical novels of Susan Fromberg Schaeffer's Anya and Sherri Szeman's The Kommandant's Mistress. The third chapter analyses the imagination as an alternative reality for mourning the past in Cynthia Ozick's The Shawl. It also engages with the dialectic between personal and collective memory through notions of ethnic uprootedness and assimilation. The fourth addresses the fantastical imagination of the Holocaust in the fiction of Judy Budnitz through her use of various literary genres and complex narratological and metafictional devices that draw attention to the acts of storytelling and witnessing. In conclusion, the thesis shows that this body of Holocaust texts examines fiction as a meaningful tool to bridge and to draw attention to the gaps between experience and representation. It broadens the implications of bearing witness due to their discourses about the significant mediation of imaginary realities.

By the 2000s Ben-Dor had directed four films with Holocaust survivors as her main protagonists. The article analyzes the central themes in Ben-Dor's Holocaust-related films and explains how the director maintains a perspective of distance. Because she so often relates in film interviews to her parents' Holocaust and her sensitivity as a second-generation Holocaust survivor, one might have expected her to engage with the topic in her autobiographical documentary, released in 2009. However, as this article will show, Ben-Dor downplays the Holocaust in this film and turns the camera inward to focus on gender rather than on the hallmark themes of her previous films: PTSD of Holocaust survivors, the transgenerational transfer of trauma to the second generation and the absorption of Holocaust survivors in Israel. As a director who has played such an important part in Israel's Holocaust commemoration, Ben-Dor remains strangely reticent about her own personal Holocaust-related story.\", 'year': 2022}, {'paperId': '95e1507e65791df6b6214bdd7fc07616d03be691', 'title': 'The acquisition of memory by interview questioning: Holocaust re-membering as category-bound activity', 'abstract': \"In this discourse analysis of how memory acquires and is acquired in interview exchanges, we investigate remembering as a category-bound activity, both a tensional and collaborative process of moral ratification of `survivor' as membership category.

Despite their exposure to a traumatized family environment, many children of Holocaust survivors do not develop emotional problems and adaptive difficulties. Some demonstrate psychological resilience, reflected by their ability to adapt to adversity and problems. The purpose of this study was to gain insight into how well-adjusted, middle aged children of Holocaust survivors developed and maintained resilience. In line with the resiliency theory, which explains how an individual bounces back from negative circumstances, the research questions for this study examined the factors that the participants used to develop and maintain resilience. The sample for this study included 13 middle-aged children of Holocaust survivors who described themselves as well-adjusted. The researcher collected data by conducting in-depth interviews and qualitatively analyzing the data using the modified van Kaam method of phenomenological analysis. Results showed that well-adjusted children of Holocaust survivors managed and maintained resiliency through middle age by incorporating lessons learned from their parents, including the notion that nothing can keep a person down. These findings contributed to the body of knowledge on trauma prevention and may be useful to social service providers and organizations that seek to aid individuals’ development of resiliency in the wake of traumatic experiences.Children of Holocaust survivors are vulnerable to experiencing secondary trauma, which typically manifests in emotional and psychological difficulties.

The plan was to stay in Denmark for a while and learn about agriculture before continuing to Palestine. Due to the breakout of the war, the plans were delayed. Not until a year and a half had passed in Denmark, his journey continued through Sweden, Finland, The Soviet Union, and Turkey to Palestine, where he enrolled in the British army and fought the Germans in North Africa. At the same time, members of his family, including his parents, were murdered in the Nazi concentration camps in Europe. Coming back to Palestine after the war, he worked as a welder in kibbutz Ein Harod and fought in the Israeli independence war before establishing his own business in Tel Aviv. Josef was content and the business was prosperous, but Josef had a wish to return to Denmark to visit the family who had hosted him during his stay there. In 1954, he travelled back to Denmark on a visitor’s visa. Although initially just planning to visit Denmark, Josef ended up staying for good.

Immediately after the end of World War II in 1945, German contemporary historians made great efforts to document and clarify the period of the Third Reich, but they did so without contemporary witnesses, because for them oral interviews were not as valuable as written historical sources. It was only in the 1970s that oral history was ‘imported’ to (West) Germany by a prominent contemporary historian, Lutz Niethammer. He and his colleagues, Alexander von Plato among them, established oral history as a viable research tool in German historiography by carrying out several major oral history projects on the working classes in Ruhr region and in East Germany before reunification. They pointed out that oral history was a powerful tool for understanding people’s experiences,a notion which had not been widely accepted in German academic history. Oral history also played an important role in communication between workers and historians in the 1980s. Recently, many oral history projects have focused on ‘victims of history’, such as those who had been oppressed by the Nazis, Holocaust survivors, forced labourers, etc., where emphasis is placed on memory. Oral history in Germany has made a great contribution to deepening and widening its historiography, but it would be premature to paint a rosy picture for the future, because of the number of challenges it faces.', 'year': 2013}, {'paperId': '999ad3dffff63e8a0935c47bd4ff8cb441d0e892', 'title': 'Confronting the Bomb: A Short History of the World Nuclear Disarmament Movement', 'abstract': \"Wittner, Lawrence S. 2009, Confronting the Bomb: A Short History of the World Nuclear Disarmament Movement. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2009 (xiv + 254) pb. US$21.95. ISBN 978-0-8047-5632-7. In the decade 1993-2003 Wittner published a trilogy of scholarly volumes on the history of the international anti-nuclear weapons movement, which arguably grew into the largest grassroots movement of all time. The three tomes, which collectively covered almost 1800 pages and thousands of footnotes, began with the prophetic warning in H.G. Wells' novel The World Set Free, published in 1914, about a fictitious war fought with 'atomic bombs.' The outcome of this war was devastating, but Wells' book had an upbeat ending. To avert an even greater catastrophe the survivors rallied to create a world government and save humanity. The modern story that Wittner chronicles over 90 years does not quite emulate the novel. Humans still have a long way to go before establishing a world government, but some progress is being made. Despite calamitous outbursts of religious, ethnic and power motivated killings, a process of globalisation is gradually moving homo sapiens in the direction of a world community. Moreover, as in the Wells plot, after witnessing the disasters of two relatively localised atomic attacks, humans have managed thus far to escape the horrors of a nuclear holocaust. How the 'great escape' eventuated is the story that unfolds in the scholarly trilogy, and is now encapsulated in a slimmer and single work aimed not only at academia but also concerned members of the general public. In the condensed version under review, Wittner sets out at the very beginning the major question that his well researched and highly readable narrative addresses. Since nations are inclined to use the weapons that they develop, how is it that nuclear war has been avoided since 1945? Moreover, only nine nations possess nuclear arsenals, while 186 for diverse reasons possess none. Those that have acquired 'the bomb' have entered into some restraining measures that indicate they are very much aware of the special dangers attached to nuclear weapons: for instance, the Partial Test Ban Treaty; Strategic Arms Limitation Treaties (SALT); Strategic Arms Reduction Treaties (START); Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT); and Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). The prevailing rationale attributes the nuclear restraint to the deterrence power of nuclear weapons. But if that is the case, why the motivation to enter into arms control and disarmament agreements? Why have the nuclear powers refrained from waging nuclear war against the unarmed nuclear nations, sometimes at the cost of losing a war? Wittner's book uncovers an answer that is not part of the conventional wisdom, even in some sections of the peace movement. He concludes 'that the missing ingrethent is a massive nuclear disarmament movement- hone that has mobilised millions of people in nations around the globe, and, thereby, saved the world from nuclear war' (xii). Admittedly that mobilisation has been uneven globally and has waxed and waned over the decades, but in terms of the nuclear threat levels the movement has responded by mobilising gigantic numbers of ordinary people as well as the key institutions of civil society. The evidence that Wittner presents in support of this assertion is overwhelming. He has extensively inspected the files of disarmament organisations, and has had access to formerly secret government records. He has interviewed countless anti-nuclear activists and government officials, and he has perused numerous memoirs, periodicals and other published materials. The details of this extensive research are laid out in the trilogy (each book of which had previously been reviewed in Social Alternatives). In Confronting the Bomb the reader receives mainly the argument and narrative. Nevertheless, he does spell out a most critical point: namely, that most government off icials were not favorably disposed to nuclear arms control and disarmament measures. …\", 'year': 2009}, {'paperId': '99cdb4df8f153d9fdbe872afbd4ff9fa0c55d3f8', 'title': 'The National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder INTERNATIONAL HANDBOOK OF MULTIGENERATIONAL LEGACIES OF TRAUMA', 'abstract': 'INTERNATIONAL HANDBOOK OF MULTIGENERATIONAL LEGACIES OF TRAUMA Yael Danieli, PhD Group Project for Holocaust Survivors and Their Children New York, NY This is the first book on traumatic stress that examines multigenerational effects of trauma across various victim/survivor populations around the world from multidimensional and multidisciplinary perspectives. Its structure follows the developmen\\xad tal foci of this field. Following a contextual intro\\xad duction, the book is divided into eleven sections that span the decades from World War II to the present, covering the intergenerational effects of genocide, the fall of communism and the aftermath of repressive regimes, crime and urban violence, and the plight of indigenous peoples. There are chapters on infectious and life-threatening diseases as well as the biology of intergenerational trauma; the final chapter attempts to synthesize those pre\\xad ceding it. A brief overview introduces each section. Part I consists of five chapters that explore the nature and prevalence of multigenerational effects of the Nazi Holocaust on its victims and perpetra\\xad tors from theoretical, clinical, and empirical view\\xad points. Auerhahn and Laub, using case examples, delineate 10 forms of intergenerational knowing (remembering) trauma, modes of transmission, and implications for prevention and healing. Felsen re\\xad views non-clinical controlled studies done in North America up to 1996, addresses the discrepancies between clinical and empirical reports, and pro\\xad poses a unifying conceptual framework for various findings. Solomon reviews and classifies all pub\\xad lished empirical studies carried out on the “second generation” in Israel up to 1995. Focusing on grand\\xad children of Nazis, Hardtmann describes psycho\\xad analytically parents’ use of denial, splitting, projec\\xad tion, and projective identifications to defend against, yet transmit to them, their past, and suggests treat\\xad ment recommendations and further exploration. Bar-on and collaborators describe seminars for Ger\\xad man and Israeli youth struggling to work through their personal and collective identities as they con\\xad front the Holocaust and each other. Part II has six chapters that report on family and intergenerational sequelae of WWII. Bernstein touches upon intergenerational implications of con\\xad flicts in adjustment in American prisoners of war, while Nagata, using a national survey and in-depth interviews, reports multiple effects of the JapaneseAmerican internment upon the third-generation (Sansei) children of internees. From Japan, focusing on Hibakusha Nisei (children of atomic bomb survi\\xad vors), Tatara illustrates the importance of the physi\\xad ological, political, socioeconomic, cultural, and so\\xad cial dimensions to understanding their intergen\\xad erational trauma. Three chapters describe groups of Dutch “children of the war.” Op den Velde reports on the diverse problems and specific family (psycho)dynamics of children of war-sailors and civilian Resistance veterans, while Lindt describes the recently-begun process of integration from their outcast status for the children of collaborators. Aarts discusses clinical and empirical findings of intergenerational effects in families of WWII survi\\xad vors from the Dutch East Indies. Part III contains two chapters describing the ef\\xad fects of genocide and migration on survivors, their cultures, and their families: Kupelian and colleagues studied the impact of Turkish persecution and geno\\xad cide of the Armenians on their ethnic identity, psy\\xad chopathology, and meaning in the second and third generations; Kinzie et al. describe effects of the Cambodian genocide on its survivors, their fami\\xad lies, their parenting abilities, and their children. Part IV includes three chapters addressing as\\xad pects of intergenerational transmission of the effects of the Vietnam War. Empirically comparing Viet\\xad nam veterans whose fathers served in combat with those who did not, Rosenheck and Fontana con\\xad cluded that intergenerational effects of trauma emerge when the second generation itself has PTSD, and are more related to intergenerational processes during the homecoming period than to differences in pre-military vulnerability. Hunter-King’s survey of children of service personnel missing in action indicates the mother’s critical role in determining their coping, and the preventive value of adequate support to the families. Ancharoff and collaborators examine several mechanisms of transmission, inter\\xad ventions, and clinical implications. Part V includes three chapters examining intergenerational effects revealed after the fall of com\\xad munism, central to which are issues of submerged ethnic identity. Klain traces, from psychoanalytic and group analytic perspectives, current inter-eth\\xad nic conflicts in the former Yugoslavia to historically remote, transgenerationally transmitted affects and memories of wartime events by families, communi\\xad ties, and nations, and makes therapeutic recommen\\xad dations.

Humanistic psychology includes a strong existential component and a recognition that affirmation of human potential and the self-actualization drive require facing and surmounting the dark and tragic side of life. Certainly this was a basic experience and teaching of Viktor Frankl and Rollo May and may be part of what distinguishes humanistic psychology from the newly popular, more simplistically optimistic “positive psychology.” For example, three articles in previous issues of JHP have described reconciliation processes between children of Holocaust survivors and descendants of Nazi perpetrators: See the articles by Mary Rothschild (Summer 2000), Busse et al.

Research shows there is a link between the parents\\' trauma and a variety of psychological symptoms in children of survivors. Children of Nazis have also been a topic of psychological and journalistic inquiry. The research suggests that many of these children experience conflict, shame, and personal guilt when dealing with their parents\\' Nazi past. The much discussed \"inability to mourn\" has been identified as the central reason for why these children were traumatized. These findings have been central to our awareness of the intergen-erational effects of the Holocaust. There is to date, however, no systematic research that compares the effects on these two groups of descendants. Thus, in an effort to advance research in this area, this study was undertaken to explore similarities between these two groups. Whereas previous studies have focused on the pathological effects of trauma on each group separately, the focus of this study was on comparative coping responses of individuals whose parents were involved in an extreme social injustice. An additional later aim is to study the interpersonal behavior between children of survivors and children of Nazis. The study consisted of interviewing 20 subjects, 10 children of Nazis and 10 children of concentration camp survivors. The former subjects were interviewed by a child of a Nazi (Kuphal), and the latter were interviewed by a child of concentration camp survivors (Weissmark). The interview was de-signed by a neutral party (Giacomo) to generate data by focusing on broad areas. The investigators hypothesized that these areas would yield useful data for comparing the similarities and differences between the two groups of sub-jects. Responses of children of survivors and Nazis revealed similar threads of images and associations to the past that run through their lives. These include: information-seeking, meaning-making, a personal sense of injustice, and re-dressing actions.

Haunted by his mother's stories of the mysterious officer who commanded hers lave labor camp, Michael Good resolved to find out all he could about the enigmatic Major Plagge. For five years, he wrote hundreds of letters and scoured the Internet to recover, in one hard-earned bit of evidence after another, information about the man whose moral choices saved hundreds of lives. This unforgettable book is the first portrait of a modest man who simply refused to play by the rules. Interviewing camp survivors, opening German files untouched for more than fifty years, and translating newly discovered letters, Good weaves an amazing tale. An engineer from Darmstadt, Plagge joined, and then left, the Nazi Party. In Vilna, in whose teeming ghetto tens of thousands of Jews faced extermination, he found himself in charge of a camp where military vehicles were repaired. Time aftertime, he saved Jews from prison, SS death squads, and the ghetto by issuing them work permits as indispensable laborers essential to the war effort. Karl Plagge never considered himself a hero, describing himself as a fellow traveler for not doing more to fight the regime. He said that he saved Jews - and others - because I thought it was my duty. This book also reminds us of the many ways human beings can resist evil. There are always some people, Pearl Good said of the man who saved her life when he didn't have to, who decide that the horroris not to be.\", 'year': 2006}, {'paperId': '9f55b3b26a53362dda0f08d089c34ca59b3fb8aa', 'title': 'Occupational Understandings from the Experiences of Holocaust Survivors', 'abstract': 'Experiences of survivors of the Jewish Holocaust can inform understandings of occupation in relation to how people manage extreme situations.

Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007. 391 pp. $21.95. The Holocaust units I created for my middle school students always included stories of survivors. From time to time we were fortunate enough to have a survivor visit the school for a personal talk. This was in the 90s, when more and more survivor stories were being collected, published, and made available to public school teachers. From these stories, a paradigmatic survivor emerged, one who had been liberated from one of the many camps, one who had somehow managed to defy death only to find that most if not all of her/his family members had been exterminated. As Holocaust scholarship continues into the 21st century, scholars are examining more closely other kinds of survivor stories - stories that challenge traditional notions of survival. In Beyond Anne Frank: Hidden Children and Postwar Families in Holland, sociologist Diane Wolf takes the reader on a disturbing journey into the world of hidden children. The book is based on over seventy interviews conducted between 1998 and 2001 with adults who were hidden as children in Holland. Wolf contends that only by examining both wartime and postwar contexts will we begin to understand the full effects of the Shoah. She uses a \"sociological lens\" to study these \"other\" survivors and their childhood memories, with the emphasis on what occurred in the days and years after the war as they dealt with their own war experiences as well as those of their parents and caregivers. While liberation meant one thing to those who survived the horrors of the camps, for hidden children liberation often ushered in yet another ordeal. As Wolf\\'s title suggests, the now ubiquitous story of Anne Frank, however powerful and enlightening, does not represent the experiences of most child survivors from the Netherlands. Beyond Anne Frank begins with a critical history of the ways in which survivor stories, and in particular the role of child survivor stories, contribute to our present understanding of the Holocaust. Wolf points out that most of the scholarly work examining the experiences of hidden children in the Netherlands focuses on Jewish orphans, bringing to light the activities of the Dutch Guardian Commission for War Foster Children (OPK) which made decisions about where and with whom Jewish orphans would be housed. Wolf offers a concise look into the relationship between the Dutch government and its Jews during the period 1940-45; unlike the popular image of the Dutch tolerance suggested by Anne Frank\\'s story, the most recent literature suggests that Dutch citizens were far more apathetic, even to the point of allowing the Nazis to deport and murder their own citizens. Only recently has the Dutch government, which for many years perpetuated the myth that the government acted in the best interests of its Jewish citizens, finally acknowledged its negligence. The chapters that present the actual stories of hidden children form the heart and soul of Beyond Anne Frank. Although Wolf documents their experiences in hiding, she found that the most common refrain from hidden children was \"my war began after the war.\" The interviews are a powerful demonstration of how the Holocaust continued - and continues - to affect the lives and families of survivors. …', 'year': 2008}, {'paperId': '9fe33423ac81c51e1eeae93e4dae0b3949c89f12', 'title': 'Exploring the Educational Potential of a Video-Interview with a Shoah Survivor', 'abstract': 'This article aims to establish what the education potential is of video-interviews with Shoah survivors that have been made available as historical sources for learners in secondary schools.

The reservation (approximately 1,100 Spokane Tribal members live there), where the effects of what Alexie chooses to call an \"on-going colonialism\" still asserts its painful presence, is central in Alexie\\'s fiction, The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven (1993) and Reservation Blues (1995). Presented as a demarcated space of suffering, Alexie\\'s fictional reservation is a place where his characters are tormented by collective memories of a genocidal past, of cavalry-approved hangings, massacres, and small-pox-infected blankets. It is a haunted place where \"faint voices ... echo[] all over\" (Reservation Blues 46) and where \"dreams ... [a]re murdered ... the bones buried quickly just inches below the surface, all waiting to break through the foundations of those government houses built by the Department of Housing and Urban Development\" (Reservation Blues 7). Although some of Alexie\\'s characters leave the reservation and enter the urban space in his second novel, Indian Killer (1996), the experience of growing up, as Alexie puts it in the interview, \"firmly within borders,\" continues to affect the characters\\' lives, especially their emotional lives. Inevitably when dealing with ethnic literature, it is impossible not to be self-conscious of one\\'s own position. As a European white female scholar, I felt compelled to raise questions of perspective, including those of nationality, ethnicity, and gender. Within this context of self-reflection, the interview touches upon issues such as the desire for a \"pure\" or authentic American Indian identity and the critical demand for the genre \"American Indian literature.\" One of the most intriguing aspects of Alexie\\'s fiction is his use of the comic. Although the subject matters in Alexie\\'s fiction are morally and ethically engaging, the same texts are often ironic, satiric, and full of humor. As the characters in a caricature-like manner stagger across the reservation, between drinking the next beer and cracking the next joke, the reader is often invited to laugh along with them, even at them. Alexie\\'s artistic vision thus mixes humor and suffering in a manner that for me resembles what Roberto Benigni does in his film Life is Beautiful or Art Spiegelman in his graphic novels, Maus: A Survivor\\'s Tale. Such a comparison becomes all the more justified in the light of one of Alexie\\'s most provocative comments in the interview, his parallel between the Indian and the Jewish Holocausts. Alexie\\'s texts can be considered trauma narratives, and the interview explores his views on trauma and the thematization of suffering. Although trauma does silence, and suffering does exist without expression in language and without metaphysics, the moment pain is transformed into suffering, it is also transferred into language. This enables the traumatized person to remember, work through, and mourn the lost object. Given the inarticulateness of many of Alexie\\'s characters, I also suggest that Alexie\\'s narratives call attention to the inherent difficulties of representing suffering. The characters are muted by the traumas of hatred and chaos, loss and grief danger and fear, and cannot--except in a few rare cases--articulate their suffering. Instead, they tend to resort to self-destructive behavior, including violence and substance abuse. Thus, while Alexie\\'s narratives demonstrate the need to give suffering a language, they also call attention to the inherent unsharability of suffering. In the interview with Alexie, I was particularly interested in his views on trauma and his thematization of suffering. While in Alexie\\'s early fiction, the reservation is a geographical space of borders and confinement, in his more recent fiction, The Toughest Indian in the World (2000) and Ten Little Indians (2003), the reservation changes its ontology and becomes a mental and emotional territory. …', 'year': 2005}, {'paperId': 'a0577aadf6826641b3443a517399ea83296c09b4', 'title': \"Claude Lanzmann's Shoah: Key Essays\", 'abstract': \"Claude Lanzmann's monumental Shoah is the most celebrated film about the Holocaust ever made. For eleven years, Lanzmann traveled the world in search of those witnesses closest to the agony of the Jews of Europe during the Nazi terror.

Thus we hear the invaluable testimonies of Richard Glazar and the barber Abraham Bomba, members of the Sonderkommando at Treblinka; of Simon Srebnik, the young boy who sang Polish and German songs as he walked through the streets of Chelmno in leg irons, and of the thousands of bodies he helped to burn; of the Czechoslovak Jew Filip Muller who survived five selections while serving in the Sonderkommando at Birkenau to witness the destruction of the Czech family camp; of Rudolf Vrba, who escaped from Birkenau to warn Hungarian Jews of their impending doom. Their first-hand accounts are confirmed in horrifying interviews Lanzmann conducted with former German guards and functionaries who scheduled the trains to the East; with average Polish farmers and townspeople who watched as their neighbors were taken away to their deaths; and with Polish heroes like Jan Karski, who tried in vain to warn Western leaders of the catastrophe unfolding on Polish soil. In counterpoint to their chilling tales, Lanzmann's camera surveys the former killing sites, mapping the terrain of mass murder and examining the monuments erected in memory of the lost Jewish communities of Europe.

She has written some of these transformations into her fictional narrator’s life. Maurer maintains that Poland is unquestionably her own and her narrator’s homeland while the United States is forever “a five star hotel”—a place in which a weary traveler rests comfortably. In her stories, then, Maurer both comments on and elaborates her own and her narrator’s multiple identities and their simultaneous, but problematic ‘stepdaughter’ rootedness in Poland. In the context of multiply and complexly situated identities, Maurer’s story “Szkola” (“The School,” 1965), offers a poignant critique of Polish history and ritualized memory in the context of her narrator’s Polish Jewish identity. It illustrates that Maurer is far from idealistic or naïve in designating Poland as her homeland. The stories’ 192 Ibid. 193 I use the edition of “The School” published in Doppelgangers, 16-28. 85 narrator, like Eva Hoffman, “accepted the world around” with a “basic self-assurance” of a child while possessing a strong “sense of [her] Jewish identity.” “The School” begins in wartime Krakow where, as a little girl, the narrator lives with her parents using “Aryan papers.” She attends the public school there, goes to church every Sunday, and, by all appearances, is just an average Catholic child. Growing up in wartime Poland requires of the young narrator a virtually schizophrenic duality. She is constantly concerned with the peril of her own and her parents’ existence at the same time as she contends with “normal” predicaments like adolescent crushes and teenage friendships. Maurer explicitly comments on Polish anti-Semitism when her narrator recalls how she moved her Polish teacher to tears when she performed a fragment of Henryk Sienkiewicz’s patriotic Trilogy (1884-1888). German authorities strictly prohibited the teaching of Polish literature and Maurer scripts this recital as a patriotic act, which makes her teacher weep openly. But when she recalls her recital, the narrator comments on Professor Piaskowska’s open anti-Semitism, teaching her pupils about Jews as an “alien body” in Poland. Though Piaskowska qualifies her statements by calling what the Germans are doing “a crime,” she is clearly in favor of purging the nation of its “impurities.” The narrator sees Piaskowska’s anti-Semitism as the most dangerous because in “criticizing” the Germans, she feels patriotic and absolves herself of any participation in the crimes, implicitly approving of their outcome. As a young girl, the narrator meditates on her teacher’s sentiments and cannot figure out “how we came to such a misunderstanding, that I felt a part of her world, but she talked about me as an 194 See the Polish interviews with Eva Hoffman in Chapter 6. 195 Henryk Sienkiewicz (1846-1916) wrote historical novels. The Trilogy consists of With Fire and Sword (1884), The Deluge (1886), and Pan Wolodyjowski (1888). 86 alien body.” But Maurer’s young narrator refuses to abdicate the Polish part of her identity and, as an adult, wishes that Piaskowska had known the irony of exactly “whom she had to thank for that moment of sentimental nationalism.” In noting the exclusion of Jews as well as those who helped them from the Polish canon of heroes, the narrator asks: “Is it right that in the Polish tradition of resistance and fighting, there is no room for these people? They put their heads down in heroic glory, but did so alone. Is it right that they passed away alone and those who remained passed away from memory while still alive?” Clearly recalling Zegota, the Polish organization that helped her own family escape Krakow, Maurer’s narrator concludes that Jewish victims of the Holocaust in Poland were forgotten because of anti-Semitism and those who helped them were forgotten because such aid found no national support. In “The School,” Maurer’s use of Polish and her representation of the narrator as inseparably Polish and Jewish, despite being rejected by the country to which she pronounces allegiance, speak to the postwar national Polish consciousness. Her use of Polish in writing her stories and her narrator’s patriotic recital bring to mind another Holocaust survivor’s use of German. In “Todesfuge” (“The Death Fuge”), Paul Celan’s use of German and the pronoun “we” as well as his parallels between Biblical figures and German literary characters call Germans to account for their wartime culpability. Similarly to Celan’s use of German, Maurer’s use of Polish and her direct critique of Polish wartime anti-Semitism call into account Poles’ culpability in the Holocaust. There 196 “The School,” 18. 197 Ibid., 21. 198 Ibid., 24. 199 John Festiner, “Translating Paul Celan’s ‘Todesfuge’: Rhythm and Repetition as Metaphor,” in Probing the Limits of Representation: Nazism and the Final Solution, ed. Saul Friedlander, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1992: 240-258. 87 is no mistake that the Germans destroyed Eastern European Jewry, but it is also clear that Maurer refuses to repudiate her Polishness precisely by refusing to let Poles “off the hook.” By using Piaskowska as a stand in for Polish responses to the Holocaust, her work calls Poles to account for their actions long before Gross’s book sparked a debate about it in Poland and the United States. As early as the mid-1960s, Maurer questioned Polish Jewish relations and challenged long-standing notions of Polish wartime heroism. Popular wisdom in Poland still blames the lack of discussion about Polish Jewish relations on pre-1989 communist insistence that there were no distinctly ethnic victims of Hitler’s murderous agenda, but all were Polish citizens and workers slated for slaughter by a genocidal capitalist regime. But there was hardly any debate about Polish wartime culpability even after the antiSemitic purges of the 1950s and late 1960s, when the majority of Polish Jews who survived the Holocaust were displaced. Maurer’s stories set in the United States add another dimension to her complexly narrated identity constructions. While in Poland, Holocaust survivors like Maurer’s protagonist negotiate Polishness and Jewishness as markers of national, ethnic, or religious belonging; in the U.S. they become further marked by their immigrant status. In stories like “Polska Idealna” (“Ideal Poland,” 1970), Maurer describes how East European survivors’ wartime past, which becomes irrelevant in the U.S., constructs the immigrant Polish Jewish American identity. In “Ideal Poland,” there are three categories of newcomers from Poland: Jewish refugees who left immediately after the war, visiting scholars from the People’s Republic of Poland, and Jewish exiles who left because of the 1968 anti-Semitic purges. 88 In this story, the narrator, who is a refugee in Germany and then an immigrant in the United States, meets a middle-aged couple who represent Poland’s newest, post-1968 exiles. The couple simultaneously disarms and angers the narrator with “their enthusiasm of new immigrants.” She is disarmed because she can still remember the UNRRA times of looking forward to a promising immigrant future, but at the same time knows, through her own experiences, the illusory nature of those promises. She wants to “inject them with the knowledge of years spent wandering aimlessly, years of illusions, speaking foreign languages like a parrot. Constantly trying to enter an alien society.” And though she realizes the impossibility of actually hiring the man to do a series of lectures at the university’s East European Studies Institute, propelled by a sense of guilt and a certain desire to protect them from inevitable immigrant turmoil, she offers to try to do so anyway. The narrator’s co-immigrant guilt is exacerbated when she sees the place where the new immigrants live. Their apartment bespeaks their utterly marginal position in the ‘New World.’ Reeking of cabbage and soap, the building is decrepit and their apartment filled with junk. Everything about their situation appears familiar, but when she attempts to remember what the future looked like from the perspective of departure and loss, she can no longer access her once naive immigrant innocence and hope. She now identifies with Zahler, another long-term refugee immigrant scholar, for example, because they 200 “Polska idealna [Ideal Poland],” in Doppelgangers, 289-310. 201 Ibid., 291. 202 The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), founded in 1943, provided aid to European countries after World War II ended.

Though they speak Polish and, as Polish Jews, were also Hitler’s victims, their immigrant innocence distances them from her. She is angered and disarmed by their enthusiastic belief that nothing but good can come out of their departure from Poland. What unites these newest exiles is their innocence and confidence that America is the promised haven. Zahler and the narrator, on the other hand, are united by their familiarity with the myths of the New World. As far removed as the narrator feels from the new exiles’ naiveté, she finds even less in common with Sampson, another of the Institute’s leading scholars, who represents the American attitude towards the newly arrived immigrants.

In fact, up to the early 1980s, there were hardly any scientific publications. There are probably three reasons for the lack of research about this topic in Germany: ( 1) the long time of latency between the end of the Nazi area in 1945 and the beginning of the investigations in the 1980s; (2) the absence of theory to conceptualize the research data; and (3) the fact that all the investigators in Germany are part of the problem they are investigating. Only after a long period oflatency, starting in the early 1980s, have there been German investigations about \"Children of Nazis.\" In 1982, for the first time, German scientists wrote on this topic in the American publication Generations of the Holocaust (Bergmann & Jucovy, 1982; Eckstaedt, 1982; Hardtmann, 1982; Rosenkotter, 1982).1t took another 13 years until a German publisher took the risk to translate and republish in Germany extracts from this important book. Peter Sichrovski published his moving interviews with children of Nazis in 1987. And strong media interest was roused in Germany when Niklas Frank displayed in public the conflict with his father, who had been the chief of Generalgouvernemt Poland from 1939 untill945, and had been sentenced to death in 1946 (Frank, 1987). Dorte von Westernhagen (1987), a German journalist, conducted considerable research over several years in order to reconstruct the biography of her father, who had been a member of the Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler and had died as a soldier toward the end of the war. In a very vivid and sensitive way, the reader received an example of how the second generation labored to save what could be saved from the ruins of the Third Reich.

Social workers and others in the mental health community in the city rallied to help those in need. However, the impact of their exposure to others\\' pain and suffering and consequent secondary traumatic stress (STS) must be realized. As a researcher and consultant, I have had since 2003 the opportunity to interview close to 50 social workers involved in the 9/11 recovery effort and provide training in managing 9/11 STS for more than 150 more. The levels of STS encountered were alarming and exacerbated by the lack of supervision and support available to the social workers during the majority of their 9/11-related work. Working with clients who had 9/11-related issues was complex. It is important to keep in mind the unique nature of this attack. The social workers had been exposed to the same disaster as their clients. For many, hearing the clients\\' stories interacted with the clinicians\\' own stress levels and concerns about the terrorist attacks, heightening the resultant STS reaction beyond the simple additive effects of the two factors taken alone (Pulido, 2005). Such factors make it important to study STS among 9/11 social workers. OVERVIEW OF STS People may manifest symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder through secondhand exposure to the trauma histories of others (Figley, 1995a). Such cases include Holocaust survivors and their children (Danieli, 1985); intimates of rape victims (Kelly, 1988); and mental health professionals who work with trauma survivors (Figley, 1995b; Stamm, Varra, Pearlman, & Giller, 2002). An independent body of literature generated from the field of traumatology has emphasized the potential for harm to therapists who specialize in trauma therapy (Figley, 1995a, 1995b; Pearlman & MacIan, 1995). Therapists are exposed to the stressors and psychic pain experienced by their clients and also carry the professional burden of being expected to remain open and available to their clients on an emotional level. It is this empathic involvement that sets the stage for the potentially deleterious effects of therapy to affect the professional (Wilson & Raphael, 1993). Figley (1995a) defined STS as the natural consequent behaviors and emotions resulting from knowledge about a traumatizing event experienced by a significant other or from helping or wanting to help a traumatized person. In the process of learning about the traumatic material of the client and trying to understand and identify with the experience, the therapist may actually experience emotions and other symptoms similar to those of the victim. Dutton and Rubinstein (1995) categorized STS reactions or symptoms in three areas: (1) indicators of psychological distress or dysfunction, (2) changes in cognitive schema, and (3) relational disturbances. Individual, organizational, social, community, and traumatic event factors may potentially either increase or decrease one\\'s vulnerability to STS (Beaton & Murphy, 1995). Disaster mental health counselors may be at particularly high risk of STS, as they can be in an unfamiliar, sometimes dangerous setting and have to deal with an overwhelming number of clients and crises issues. STS is expected to be higher in disasters that are low in predictability and high in destruction and duration of impact, as was 9/11. The fact that 9/11 was a deliberate and intentional act may also heighten the potential for STS (Creamer & Liddle, 2005). WORKING WITH 9/11 CLIENTS The social workers\\' experiences differed on the basis of the type of 9/11 client. Some were dealing directly with family members who had lost loved ones, others dealt with people who fled the burning towers, and others worked with individuals considered \"indirectly\" exposed, but who were still fearful and symptomatic. …', 'year': 2007}, {'paperId': 'a44159fa6334ef18cdd3b1d6736a787fa991d5ea', 'title': \"Symptoms of Psychological Problems among Children of Holocaust Survivors: Faye Sholiton's The Interview\", 'abstract': None, 'year': 2020}, {'paperId': 'a45bf7a5ff8b12814a664de20f0945b367b84386', 'title': 'The National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder PTSD RESEARCHQUARTERLY', 'abstract': 'On April 14, 2003, the International Human Ge\\xad nome Sequencing Consortium, led in the United States by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and the Department of Energy, announced that the human genome had been se\\xad quenced. With the Human Genome Project com\\xad plete, NHGRI has outlined its vision for the future of genetics research (Collins et al., 2003). A major new focus is the development of tools to identify genes that contribute to common, complex disor\\xad ders including mental disorders such as PTSD. As we are entering the “era of the genome,” the time has come for considering the current state of the literature on the genetics of PTSD. From the vantage point of genetics research, PTSD is considered a complex or polygenetic disorder. Unlike Huntington’s disease and other disorders that are caused by a single gene, there is likely no “PTSD gene” that is necessary and sufficient for the development of the disorder. Instead, there are probably many different genes, each of which con\\xad tributes interchangeably and additively, in a proba\\xad bilistic fashion, to the inherited liability for PTSD. Genetics research in PTSD has followed a logical series of steps, similar to that of genetics research on other disorders. First, family studies were conducted. If PTSD is genetic, family members of individuals with PTSD should have a higher prevalence of PTSD. PTSD prevalence should be higher in firstdegree relatives (parents, siblings, children) than secondor third-degree relatives because first-degree relatives share more of their genes. Next, twin studies have shown the relative magnitude of genetic and environmental influences on individual differences in trauma exposure and PTSD. More recently, candidate gene association studies have sought to identify specific genes that increase risk of PTSD. Family studies. There are two main methods for conducting family studies: the family history method and the family study method. Both methods begin by selecting cases and controls, which are called probands in genetic studies. The family history method collects psychiatric information about all family members by interviewing the proband. Family history studies are conducted using instruments designed for this purpose such as the Family Interview for Genetic Studies (FIGS). The family study method, on the other hand, interviews all family members directly using an instrument such as the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (DIGS). Family studies of PTSD have primarily used some variation of the family history method. The family history method has several well-documented limitations. Overall, family history studies tend to underestimate the prevalence of mental disorders in relatives. Moreover, proband reports of diagnostic status in relatives are influenced by their own history of psychopathology (Khoury et al., 1993). Compared with other disorders, such as major depression, relatively few family studies of PTSD have been conducted. Most evidence for the role of familial risk factors in PTSD comes from epide\\xad miological studies. The results of such studies are contradictory. Moreover, most suggest familial psychopathology increases risk of both trauma exposure and PTSD, although the mechanism by which this occurs is unclear. A family history of psychopathology could increase risk of PTSD di\\xad rectly or indirectly. In my own study of familial risk factors for PTSD, I found that a family history of conduct disorder, major depression, panic disorder or GAD, and substance dependence were each significantly associated with PTSD. However, this association is indirect, mediated by increased risk of trauma exposure and pretrauma psychopathology (Koenen et al., 2002). Only a few family studies have specifically ex\\xad amined whether relatives of PTSD probands have an increased prevalence of PTSD. In one such study, Sack and colleagues (1995) compared the preva\\xad lence of PTSD in Cambodian refugee children whose parents had PTSD with the prevalence in refugee children whose parents did not develop PTSD. When compared to children whose parents did not have PTSD, children whose mothers or fathers had PTSD were almost five times more likely to receive the diagnosis. Similar findings have been shown in a series of studies on adult children of Holocaust survivors with PTSD. Results of this work show that these children have a higher risk of PTSD following trauma exposure than adult children of Holocaust survivors without PTSD (Yehuda et al., 1998; Yehuda et al., 2001). One difficulty for family studies of PTSD is that the disorder cannot be assessed in relatives who have not experienced a traumatic event. Since it is unknown whether these relatives would have developed PTSD had they been exposed, information on PTSD diagnostic status for such relatives must be treated as missing data. To get around this problem, several family studies have examined whether', 'year': 2002}, {'paperId': 'a46b63d6f7c721d1ddeb14cc041e420ce8b71972', 'title': 'Child Survivors of the Holocaust — Strategies of Adaptation *', 'abstract': 'Child survivors have only recently been recognized as a developmentally distinct group with psychological experiences different from older survivors.

Cohen. (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press in association with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 2007), 224 pp., cloth $44.95. Beth Cohen’s well-researched volume is the latest work on a topic that has been debated in both the scholarly and popular literature since the end of World War II: the question of how well Holocaust survivors adapted to life after the war. Cohen’s focus is on the one-third who came to America. In the early postwar period, many articles emphasizing the successful adjustment of the immigrants appeared in the general media and in publications such as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society’s Rescue. But there was an agenda here. The agencies that served the new arrivals wanted the doors to Jewish immigration to remain open, and they therefore portrayed the survivors as resilient, eager, and ready to start new lives. A somewhat different picture was presented by social-work professionals, prominent among them Carol Meyer, Elaine Mishkin, and Mary Russak. Their work detailed the problems that aid workers faced in dealing with the DPs, but offered a cautiously optimistic finding that, with proper help, survivors could succeed in America. Beginning in the mid-1950s, less was written on the topic. The survivors themselves were busy rebuilding their lives; the traumas that they had endured were buried as they raised families and pursued careers. Then, in the 1970s and 1980s, the survivors’ inability to forget became the focus of extensive research in the fields of psychology and psychiatry. Basing themselves largely on interviews with their own patients, scholars such as Henry Krystal, William Niederland, Milton Jucovy, Martin Bergmann, and Leo Eitinger argued that the survivors had been seriously and permanently damaged by their suffering. In the 1990s, the intellectual ground shifted yet again, as new research by Boaz and Eva Kahana, John Sigal, Morton Weinfeld, the author of this review, and others, found that the survivors had done quite well despite their trauma. Previous research had over-emphasized maladjustment, they found, because it tended to focus on those who had been in therapy rather than on the “typical” survivor. Thus, Beth Cohen’s work is actually the latest addition to a debate that has swung back and forth through the years. As is so often the case in such debates,', 'year': 2008}, {'paperId': 'a56c9144bf333744116ab5e9e81beacc543fbc51', 'title': 'Chrétiens et juifs sous Vichy (1940–1944): Sauvetage et désobéissance civile (review)', 'abstract': 'ward acted as a form of social medicine (p. 294). The overall conclusions of the book extend further. They suggest that the experiences of hidden children differed from those of child survivors who returned from captivity. They also suggest that most of the formerly hidden children were dissuaded by their families from voicing their memories in the postwar period— the ones who did so were more often those who remained in orphanages where they had contact with others who shared similar experiences. Finally, the author looks at the implications of her study for sociology, stressing in particular its importance in relation to the “notion of the family” and to questions of custody, foster care, adoption, and family unification (pp. 337–38). The implications of Wolf’s work for Holocaust studies center on the character of Jewish families and the almost insuperable difficulty of returning to a normal life after this most extraordinary and traumatic of periods. It also suggests that Jewish collective memory is not homogenous (p. 341), and even within the community there was a hierarchy of suffering that had long-term consequences. Professor Wolf claims only a limited competence in Dutch (pp. 37, 61), and thus relies heavily on the relatively few English-language works on her period. She is highly complimentary to the present reviewer’s work, but does make one or two errors, for example, in attributing some of my conclusions to interviews (p. 134) when they had in fact been gleaned from contemporary reports collected for the official history of the war. More seriously, she misquotes a statement reproduced in an article by Hans Blom (p. 56) to imply that Eichmann thought it a pleasure to work with the Dutch; in fact the quotation related to the deportation trains running on time and being a pleasure to watch.

It thus serves as an initiation in several respects-for most students, to the !itudy of the Holocaust and of survivor testimony in particular; to university courses and the seminar format; and, quite essentially, to the challenges of self-conscious listening itself. The ways we attend to survivor testimony in our teaching will reflect, of course, the ways we approach it in our work in general. As a clinical psychologist and playwright, I have been centrally concerned with how survivors retell: not only their use of narrative form but also survivors\\' specific, situated uses of repetition, silence, and voice.

Indeed, professors of French pioneered the study of trauma in literature, which originated in the 1990s, as a way of interpreting texts relating to the Second World War and specifically to the Holocaust or Shoah. This trend has yet to run its course. When my department tan a search for a new assistant professor of twentieth-century French literature two years ago, more than a few candidates applied with what seemed to be identical dissertations devoted to trauma in the testimonial narratives of Charlotte Delbo, Saul Friedlander, Georges Perec, Claude Lanzmann, and Marguerite Duras, or some combination thereof. For what it\\'s worth, however, the Romanic Review seems to have remained trauma-free, at least through the end of the 1990s. Adapted from a clinical context, trauma theory presupposes an event too horrific to be psychically assimilated by a perceiving subject. Unable to process this event or move beyond it, the subject remains bound to it in ways he or she cannot consciously grasp. Manifestations of the trauma emerge in the subject\\'s actions, but more significantly in language, through points of logical disjuncture in testimonial narrative and endless metaphorical figurations of a truth that cannot be named. If these linguistic effects of trauma sound reminiscent of the way that certain deconstructionist critics characterize all language, or all writing, this is not a coincidence. Many of the most prominent literary theorists of trauma, such as Shoshana Felman, were associated with deconstruction and with the leading deconstructionist critic, Paul de Man, who was Felman\\'s colleague at Yale until his death 1983. It hardly seems a coincidence that the rise of trauma as a critical paradigm followed the revelation in 1987 that de Man had published a series of collaborationist and anti-Semitic articles as a young journalist in Belgium during World War II. To be sure, the de Man controversy occupies a central place in Testimony\" Crises of Witnessing in Literature, Psychoanalysis, and History, authored by Felman in conjunction with the psychiatrist Dori Laub, which, perhaps more than any other book, helped popularize trauma theory in literary studies. An attempt to account for the unique problems involved in representing the Holocaust, Testimony juxtaposes chapters by Laub on survivor testimony with a series of essays by Felman on Albert Camus, Claude Lanzmann, and de Man. In the section on de Man, Felman portrays her late colleague as a survivor of catastrophe who, like the concentration camp survivors interviewed by Laub, bears exemplary witness to \"the trauma of contemporary history\" through his silence and refusal to confess his collaborationist past (Felman 164). In Representing the Holocaust: History, Theory, Trauma, Dominic LaCapra offers perhaps the most biting critique of Felman\\'s chapter on de Man, showing how she inadvertently supplies the very confession she deems unnecessary. (1) The attacks leveled at certain key manifestations of trauma theory have not stopped it from gaining currency as a tool for examining representations not only of the Holocaust and World War II but of other historical periods as well. In fact, and this will be the real subject of this essay, one of the main arenas of its deployment has been nineteenth-century studies. The French nineteenth century was not without its own horrific events, many of which were, if not as uniquely horrible as World War II, nevertheless worthy of inspiring trauma. Napoleon\\'s Russian campaign comes to mind, in which over a million people are estimated to have been killed (including 300,000 French soldiers).

In this article, however, one strand follows Giorgio Agamben’s presentation of “remnants of Auschwitz”, which is based on the story of Hasidic children’s experience of surviving World War II, and how for some survivors, the guilt of surviving while others perished is too great a burden to bear, so much so that suicide seems their only route to peace. A further strand builds on Rebecca Schneider’s ideas about the very act of re-enacting remembrance as a performance, which remains once all living memories of historical facts are gone. On a more specific level, Memoria brings together the narrative of the Hasidic Tales of the Holocaust (1983) with memories from philosophers such as Primo Levi and Jean Améry, with Else Marie Laukvik and Frans Winther giving voice to these speechless memories. Laukvik, who is the author of the Memoria script, also manages to embody the conflict that can arise from remembering in her performance.

The article draws on interviews conducted in 2013 with a members of a Northern Irish family in which the father was present at Bloody Sunday, the paratrooper attack on protesters in Derry on January 30, 1972, or The author proposes that the Northern Irish experience departs from the usual accounts of postmemory as reported by Holocaust survivors and their families. A significant difference is that whereas Holocaust survivors privilege the narrativization of the traumatic experience as means of keeping memory alive, in Northern Ireland the sharing of traumatic narratives is seen as engendering hatred and putting subsequent generations at risk. Though writers on postmemory prioritize photographs that show the parent at a traumatic juncture as a medium of transgenerational memory transfer, the Northern Irish father appears in the single most famous photograph ever taken during the “Troubles”—yet the son’s understanding of the event was confused and superficial.

In this article a prospective, case-comparison study was conducted in order to assess the association between Holocaust experience and quality-of-life of older patients before and after an open-heart surgery, and to examine factors associated with differences in quality-of-life. Sixty-four Holocaust survivors and 53 comparison patients who were not exposed to a major trauma were interviewed in the Department of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery at Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel before open-heart surgery, and 60 Holocaust survivors and 47 comparison patients were interviewed at 6 months. The interview included background data, mastery scale, and quality-of-life measured by the Nottingham Health Profile. Medical data were retrieved from the patients' charts. The Holocaust survivors reported greater problems than the comparison patients only in emotional reactions and pain components of quality-of-life at admission, and in emotional reactions and energy at follow-up. The improvement in quality-of-life over time was similar in both groups. In multivariate analyses of emotional reaction, the differences between the groups at admission remained statistically significant after controlling for education and medical status but disappeared when mastery was included. At follow-up, being a Holocaust survivor (OR = 2.56, 95% CI = 1.0–6.6), and having lower education and lower feelings of mastery were associated with higher levels of emotional reaction. The moderate differences indicate that older Holocaust survivors are not more vulnerable to problems in quality-of-life when confronted with this life-threatening medical condition. This may be further generalized to other ageing patients with past severe prolonged traumatization.

Drawing on a range of oral history interviews, I examine how place functions in oral history narratives in complex ways. On the most obvious level, the events being described not only occurred in a different time but also a different place with distance and disjuncture in both time and space significant as the then and there is narrated in the here and now. But what is more striking are the ways in which microgeographies function as ways of meditating difficult events. In the cases discussed, Holocaust survivors (and others close to them) go places in their memory that they never went in reality and went places in reality where they are not willing to go in their memory. Taken together, it appears that survivors adopt a range of spatial strategies of memory as they physically place themselves vis-à-vis others in Holocaust landscapes as a way of narrating familial separation and violence.

This terrible fact is supported by evidence demonstrating the large number of genocides that have occurred since the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in 1948, the best known of which took place in Cambodia, the Former Yugoslavia, and Rwanda, although there were many others. Hundreds of books have been written about the Rwandan Genocide and although far fewer have been written about the atrocities in Darfur, there are still plenty to choose from. While only deniers contest that what transpired in Rwanda was clearly a case of genocide, the arguments over how to classify violence in Darfur have been more complex and uncertain. Some have deemed the conflict to be ethnic cleansing or crimes against humanity, while others assert it was clearly genocide. Interestingly, while the United States government deemed it genocide, the United Nations International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur (COI) asserted that it was a case of crimes against humanity. Just as critics of the US position claim that power politics were at the heart of the decision to call Darfur genocide, critics of the COI decision claim that a different set of political interests drove the COI’s position. In addition to this ongoing geopolitical debate over the appropriateness of applying the “G” word to the Darfuri case, scholars remain entrenched on different sides of this debate. Making a powerful case for identifying and raising awareness about genocide are two new books by Samuel Totten: We Cannot Forget: Interviews with Survivors of the 1994 Genocide in Rwanda (co-edited with Rafiki Ubaldo) and An Oral and Documentary History of the Darfur Genocide. These masterful works combine oral history with scholarly analysis and official documents to challenge naysayers’ arguments. Both collections use interview data to effectively demonstrate that the human turmoil that took place in Rwanda and Sudan was motivated by an overarching theme of genocidal intent, perhaps the most useful concept for distinguishing genocide from war crimes. The interviews in We Cannot Forget add greatly to our understanding of events and perceptions surrounding the horrific, 100-day genocide in Rwanda, which resulted in 500,000 to 1 million deaths. As relatively few Rwandan survivor testimonies make it into this type of literature, Totten and Ubaldo address a significant lacuna. Existing testimonies tend to be from geographically limited parts of Rwanda and do not provide in-depth accounts about the survivors’ experiences before and after the genocide.1 Though We Cannot Forget focuses only on the stories of the survivors and not the perpetrators, the text presents detailed interviews with a diverse pool of individuals covering events in the years leading up to, during, and following the genocide, with the', 'year': 2012}, {'paperId': 'aa7c1eb608bf1b8ac7485177626bb517efe6cf12', 'title': 'Project Holocaust Memorial Day 2015: ‘surviving’, connecting past and present by personal stories of survivors (WWII, Iraq, Afghanistan)', 'abstract': 'Abstract In teaching about refugees past and present, it is essential to develop empathy for people who have suffered from war, violence, persecution or even genocide.

One hopes that Robert Jay Lifton\\'s study may not suffer from the ennui this surfeit has begun to impose on the nation\\'s readership. How did men and women trained, sworn and professionally fulfilled as healers ease into the task of mass murder? Through nearly a decade spent reading the archival records and interviewing former Nazi physicians, imprisoned physicians who worked under their orders, and survivors of their ministrations, psychiatrist Lifton found that most Nazi doctors were quite ordinary: \"neither inherently evil nor particularly ethically sensitive\" (p. 4). Yet, if they were banal people, their work was demonic, and Lifton wanted to know what grotesque shift enabled healers to be killers. It has become a convention to insist that any comparison of the Holocaust to other acts of murderous inhumanity dishonors the Jews who perished at Nazi hands. Lifton is not of that mind. His insights into the motivations of Nazi doctors aspire to \"raise broader questions about human behavior, about ways in which people, individually and collectively, can embrace various forms of destructiveness and evil, with or without the awareness of doing so\" (p. 417). Genocide and its fellow plagues are possible within any nation and any person, and the psychic paths to such murderous behavior had better be widely known than imagined to have perished with the Third Reich. German doctors showed an early affinity for the Nazi movement. Fortyfive percent of them were party members, much more than in other professions. In the SS they outnumbered teachers proportionately seven to one.

To what extent do the Judeo-Spanish language and expressions determine the center of gravity of the stories? And why do the tellers of the stories choose to incorporate Judeo-Spanish expressions into their Hebrew-written life stories? These are some of the central questions addressed in the present paper, which suggests that the purpose of incorporating Judeo-Spanish to these stories is to render them more powerful and to make the Judeo-Spanish experience more accessible to those who are not part of it. It is interesting to note that it is the very fact that Judeo-Spanish was a minority language in the extermination camps which makes the life stories of its speakers who survived particularly forceful. The Judeo-Spanish language preserved in their memory, which became an “informal language” in the camps, acquires a new vitality in their life stories. We center our discussion on the autobiographies of Greek survivors and on testimonies gathered in interviews with those survivors.

Only a few studies have been undertaken among civilian survivors of WWII. Objectives The purpose of this study was to examine the association between perceived social acknowledgment of WWII trauma and the level of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive symptoms among Polish survivors of WWII by employing a mixed-methods design (i.e., a quantitative analysis supported by qualitative interviews). Method In the quantitative part, 123 participants filled out: the list of WWII-related traumatic events, the PTSD Checklist for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (PCL-5), the shortened version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and the Social Acknowledgment Questionnaire (SAQ). In the qualitative part, an interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) of participants’ reminiscences of WWII was examined. Results Although we observed a direct positive association between the number of WWII-related traumatic events and the intensity of PTSD and depressive symptoms, these relationships changed when we entered the social acknowledgment construct into the model. Specifically, we found that perceived social acknowledgment (general disapproval) was a mediator of the relationship between the number of WWII traumatic events and the intensity of PTSD symptoms only, and not of depressive symptoms. In the qualitative part, three themes relating to traumatic reminiscences emerged among the participants: parental efficacy, parental betrayal, and support from the invader.

The Četniks, a remnant of the Royal Serbian army, primarily hunted the Jews. Historians as well as survivors were eager to expose the atrocities so that people around the globe would know what had happened. Although there is a plethora of historiographic literature on the machinery of murder in the Serbian and Croatian death camps, it is plagued by disputes over the number of victims. Moreover, much of it is written to defend one or another ethnic perspective. Thus, Raphael Israeli writes that he came “to the mixed conclusion that the horrors of Jadovno and Jasenovac have to be reported to the public in some nonpartisan way.” His intent to revisit the subject of Croatian death camps might seem a refreshing approach. Israeli’s actual text consists of 194 pages, comprising a foreword, an introduction, and eight chapters: “The German Expansion into the Balkans”; “The Roots of the Ustaše Regime”; “The Jadovno Complex”; “The Middle East Connection”: “The Muslim Connection and Haj Amin al-Husseini”; “Jasenovac: The Routinization of Mass Murder”; “The Suppression of War Memories and Their Reemergence”; and “Summary and Conclusions.” Unfortunately, the book fails to provide new insights into the conflict between the Serbs and Croats, neither about the wartime atrocities nor about the number of victims. Because Israeli does not know Serbo-Croatian, his bibliography lacks primary sources, including diaries, memoirs, contemporary newspapers, and interviews with those who experienced these years. The book is based essentially on secondary sources, predominantly books written or translated into English (pp. 191–193). Israeli’s unfamiliarity with Serbo-Croatian also results in frequent misspellings of individuals’ names and locations. The Death Camps of Croatia loses focus on its stated subject when it ventures from wartime Yugoslavia and its concentration camps to present-day conflicts. In particular, by introducing a totally irrelevant Middle East connection with a follow-up on the Muslim connection and Haj-Aminal-Husseini, it needlessly confuses readers. Despite Israeli’s intent to relate his subject to current issues, his chapter “The Suppression of War Memories and Their Reemergence” largely ignores the current situation in Croatia. Although Josip Broz Tito’s regime restricted the use of official archives to a few select historians, the situation has long been much different. After the Yugoslav wars of separation in the 1990s, the Croatian state archives in Zagreb were opened to the public.

Therefore, the current studies assessed filial anxiety and sense of obligation among offspring of Holocaust survivors (OHS) in caring for their parents. Method: In Study 1, we interviewed 10 OHS (mean age = 61.0) in order to extract themes of filial anxiety. Based on Study 1's data, a newly constructed scale of filial anxiety was administered in Study 2 to 59 adult offspring (mean age = 56.4): 28 OHS and 31 comparisons. Study 3 included 143 dyads of parents and offspring (mean age = 55.4 and 81.7, respectively): 86 Holocaust dyads and 57 comparison dyads. Parents reported posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and offspring reported filial anxiety and sense of obligation. Results: In Study 1, interviewees referred to concerns about parent experiencing decline alongside caregiving difficulties. In Study 2, OHS reported higher filial anxiety and sense of obligation relative to comparisons. This group difference was mediated by sense of obligation. In Study 3, OHS with parental PTSD reported higher filial anxiety and sense of obligation relative to comparisons. Once more, filial sense of obligation served as a mediator. In Studies 2–3, results remained significant after adjusting for offspring symptoms.

The interviews and presentations include a wide variety of survival experiences all over war-torn Europe as well as the survivors’ recollections of their arrival in the United States. The Goucher Testimony Collection adds another aspect to existing archived oral history interviews: the survivors entrust their stories to interviewers the ages of their own grandchildren. The interviews as well as the digitized storytelling presentations are a rich source for comparative analyses with interviews from other collections and/or other forms of testimonies. The techniques and approaches are also applicable to other oral history/storytelling projects, such as with war veterans or immigrants.', 'year': 2017}, {'paperId': 'adb692013a60e1a7eb79ca4759e92fd5245a4f2d', 'title': 'Review: Dirk Michel (2009).

Most studies focusing on political movements only implicitly address the connection between biographical experiences and political attitudes. Moreover, a detailed understanding of these impacts often remains merely hypothetical. Biographical studies increasingly address the relationship between politics and biography through empirical and hermeneutic approaches. For his doctoral thesis, Dirk MICHEL conducts autobiographical narrative interviews with 20 Jewish Israelis. Based on their extraordinary biographical experiences, MICHEL categorized the interviewees into two groups—the \"German Zionists\" and the \"German Holocaust survivors.\" He then conducts semi-structured interviews with each of the participants with the aim of analyzing their political attitudes. However, the conceptual categorization of the interviewees, the empirical investigation of the research question and the subsequent analysis all challenge the underpinning theoretical and methodological concepts of the study.

Laurence Olivier, for example, has directed and acted in some splendid motion pictures, but the best of these are theatrically based. Olivier has been considered an actor\\'s actor, and the stage is and has been his proper medium. Other British actors have made smoother and more complete transitions to the screen, but not all. The late Richard Burton\\'s greatest film roles-Look Back in Anger, The Taming of the Shrew, and Who\\'s Afraid of Virginia Woolf, for example-were generated by theatrical vehicles. On the other hand, Nicol Williamson\\'s Hamlet is splendid on film, arguably more plausible than Olivier\\'s, but as an acting performance, matched by his later portrayal of Merlin in John Boorman\\'s Excalibur. Kevin Kline represents a new generation of American actors trained on the stage but also highly effective on the motion picture screen. Born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri, Kline studied music and drama at Indiana University, where the Bloomington campus boasts one of the strongest programs in the country in music and opera. He first majored in music at Indiana University but eventually got hooked on theatre when he took a course in acting and then got involved in campus productions. He is still an accomplished pianist, and has said that \"playing the piano is my therapy.\" The melding of his musical and theatrical talents eventually was realized during the summer of 1980 with his highly acclaimed rendering of the Pirate King in Joseph Papp\\'s The Pirates of Penzance in New York\\'s Central Park, after Kline had moved on to the Julliard Drama Center and after he had gained much theatrical experience as a founding member of John Houseman\\'s Acting Company. During his four years with The Acting Company, Kline played lead roles in a classical repertoire that included The School for Scandal, She Stoops to Conquer, The Three Sisters, and The Lower Depths. More recently Kevin Kline played Shakespeare\\'s Richard III and Henry V to very good notices. Frank Rich of The New York Times wrote, for example, \"Mr. Kline is a grand King,\" against whom \"most other American actors of his generation are mere pretenders to the throne.\" Kline won his first Tony Award for his Broadway debut in the musical On the Twentieth Century (with Imogene Coca, Madeline Kahn, and John Cullum), then was featured in Michael Weller\\'s play Loose Ends that opened at Washington\\'s Arena Stage before moving on to Broadway. In Los Angeles he played with Marurice Evans, Sally Kellerman, and Marisa Berenson in the Ahmanson Theatre revival of Philip Barry\\'s Holiday, first introduced in 1928. Kevin Kline\\'s breakthrough performance, however, was with Linda Ronstadt, Rex Smith, and George Rose in The Pirates of Penzance, first in Central Park, then, later, on Broadway. That performacne won a second Tony Award for Kline as Best Actor in a Musical Comedy and assured him of a role in the motion picture version of Penzance. After director Alan J. Pakula had seen Kline\\'s Pirate King on Broadway, he was so impressed that he signed Kline for the role of Nathan in his screen adaptation of William Styron\\'s novel Sophie\\'s Choice, with Meryl Streep and Peter MacNicol. Kline told The New York Times (12 December 1982) that he prepared for that role \"by reading up on subjects ranging from the Holocaust to the work of R. D. Laing.\" His mother was Roman Catholic and he was educated by the Benedictine monks in St. Louis, but his father was Jewish, and this biographical link helped him to understand Nathan \"in terms of understanding what it meant to be a Jew in 1947, when people were finding out about \\'The Final Solution,\\' the guilt of survivors,\" he told The New York Times, and \"Nathan\\'s guilt about not being part of it, about being safe and sound in Brooklyn while his people were being annihilated.\" Kline\\'s next movie was The Big Chill, directed by Lawrence Kasdan in South Carolina, a larger popular success than Sophie\\'s Choice, one supposes, because of its story and often nostalgic 1960s ambience. …', 'year': 1986}, {'paperId': 'ae01fd69955380a0b5a73beab8a1b1e51b0a1ee0', 'title': 'Exodus to Berlin: The Return of the Jews to Germany', 'abstract': 'In the years following the Holocaust, the Jewish community in Germany was tiny, decimated by the Nazis and shrinking fast as most survivors died or emigrated. But once the Berlin Wall fell, the German government invited Soviet-bloc Jews to come make a new life in prosperous and democratic Germany. Exodus to Berlin tells the story of that migration. Since 1989 more than 100,000 Jews have accepted Germany\\'s invitation, filling Berlin and the rest of the country with a vibrant subculture. Germany now wakes up to synagogues filling for services, bagels and blintzes in new restaurants, and the mournful strains of Klezmer music in clubs and street festivals. Jews are finding sanctuary in Germany from the anti-Semitism, violence, and economic chaos that plague the former Soviet empire. But almost simultaneous with the first flow of Jewish immigrants, and stimulated by the failure of German unification to deliver promised prosperity to the former East Germany, neo-Nazis have been on the march in Germany, vowing to reclaim \"Germany for the Germans!\" More than a hundred murders and countless acts of vandalism are blamed on marauding right-wingers. Peter Laufer brings this current history to life through vivid narratives of events he experienced in Germany and dozens of highly personal interviews he conducted with the participants-Jews as they arrived at Germany\\'s border, neo-Nazis who want to send those immigrants to Israel.

The study comprised 214 older adults: 107 Holocaust survivors and 107 comparison participants; 101 women and 113 men. The mean age for the participants was 80.7 ± 4.7 years (range 68-93). Holocaust survivors did not differ from comparison subjects in general health measures (mean 51.50 ± 3.06 vs. 52.27 ± 3.24, respectively). However, the Holocaust survivors' subjective health was significantly lower, F (2,211) = 4.18, P < 0.05, and associated with decreased quality of life.

Method: Using a web-based survey and structured clinical interviews with adult children of survivors, we attempted to predict disorders from offspring’s circumstances, perceptions of parents’ posttrauma adaptational styles, and self-reported reparative adaptational impacts. Posttrauma adaptational styles encompass intrafamilial and interpersonal psychological, social and behavioral coping, mastery, and defense mechanisms used by each parent. Reparative adaptational impacts reflect the offspring’s self-reported insecurity about their own competence, reparative protectiveness, need for control, obsession with the Holocaust, defensive psychosocial constriction, and immature dependency. Results: Of the disorders studied, generalized anxiety disorder was most frequent, followed by major depressive episode and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Only 2 variables independently predicted these disorders: participants’ age and reparative adaptational impacts. Parents’ styles were correlated with the presence of disorder, but had no effect when the child’s reparative impacts were controlled. The age effect was consistent with epidemiologic research showing lower prevalence of psychological disorder in older cohorts. The severity of participants’ reparative impacts was unequivocally the most important (OR = 5.3) or at least the most proximal precursor to the development of psychological disorders. When reparative impacts were low, frequency of disorder was low (8%); when reparative impacts were high, frequency of disorder was high (46%).

In December 1987, when the First Intifada broke out, I was on duty as the psychologist of the southern region of the IDF in the reserves, and I was supposed to be recruited only in emergency situations. I was on leave from teaching at the university and was spending my time writing about my interviews with descendants of Nazi perpetrators in Germany (Bar-On 1989). More specifically, I felt as if I were being torn apart, wrestling with the question of whether I should continue to write about the legacy of the Holocaust from the perspective of the descendants of the survivors and the perpetrators, or whether I should attempt to contribute within the realm of the newly evolving catastrophe raging in the country. Indeed, I was spending every evening watching televised footage of Israeli soldiers responding with violence to Palestinian protesters in the West Bank and Gaza. I called my colleague, Professor Charlie Greenbaum from the Hebrew University, who had the equivalent military role in the central region.

We are a killer species. There\\'s no question about that. As a novelist, you have to cope honestly with that killer side... The dark side is man\\'s powerful ability to destroy and create at the expense of other people.\"1 As this article will consider, violence plays a central and complicated role in Potok\\'s works. The idea that a \"novelist\" must \"cope honestly\" with aggression produces a tension between narrative plot and historical relevance. At times, the historical backdrop of his novels threatens to outweigh the fictive impact; at times, however, the thematic message resonates with historical memory and the two work to complement each other. This uneasy balance is most readily evident in Potok\\'s novels that contain a Jewish theme, because these novels regularly include the Shoah as the backdrop to other kinds of violence set in the foreground. So, for example, Davita\\'s Harp, which is set between 1936 and 1942, primarily involves the fight against fascism and the Spanish Civil War and, secondarily, involves the destruction of European Jewry. In My Name Is Asher Lev, the figure of Jacob Kahn, the artist who teaches Asher Lev, and his wife, Tanya, are the background figures whose aesthetic and religious outlook has been informed by the death of family members in Nazi Germany. In The Gift of Asher Lev, Asher\\'s wife is a Holocaust survivor and her history and the loss of her family inspires their return to his family\\'s home. This article focuses primarily on the violence found in Potok\\'s first two novels, The Chosen (1967), and its sequel, The Promise (1969), because these novels, as his earliest published work, set the pattern for later novels in terms of representing the Shoah and negotiating its place in a fictional setting. Both novels are set in the late 1930s and 1940s; The Chosen takes place during the years of World War II and The Promise, set during its aftermath, serves as a historical and fictional continuation. Certainly, the violence of these two novels is advanced and colored by the violence of the Second World War, and, more specifically, the destruction of European Jewry, which serves as their historical backdrop.

DVWW-OPJENU. $32.98. In the early twentieth century, opera underwent a sea change as the dissonant strands of musical modernism and the burgeoning ideas of psychology began to drift onto the stage. Audiences, caught in a rapidly industrializing world, sought to understand their situation through the theater. Composers, for their part, embraced the new freedoms granted by those shifting audience expectations and began telling stories unlike those that already existed. Many scaled back their scope, weaving tales of more modest proportions, while others delved into the inner world of thought and belief, both conscious and unconscious. These two admittedly broad responses, among the many from the period, are clearly borne out in the recent DVD releases of Leos Janacek\\'s and Arnold Schoenberg\\'s greatest operatic works, Jenufa and Moses und Aron. The nature of these DVDs speaks both to the place of these works in the modern repertoire and to the shifting current of modern audience expectation. Schoenberg\\'s Moses und Aron is often acknowledged as one of the composer\\'s masterpieces in the twelve-tone language, but its troubled compositional history, daunting stage directions, and undramatic subject matter have kept it out of the performing repertoire. Schoenberg first conceived the work in 1922 as a cantata, but by 1930, had refashioned it into an opera libretto. He began composing the work and finished its first two acts by 1932, but he stalled there and never completed the work nor saw any of it performed. In fact, as the director of this particular production, Reto Nickler, notes in an interview included with the DVD, that Schoenberg did not think the work performable. With Moses und Aron, Schoenberg turned to operatic territory unexplored neither in his earlier Erwartung (1909) and Die gluckliche Hand (1910-13), nor in many other contemporaneous operas, namely the metaphysical. Moses and Aron represent for Schoenberg two different responses to spiritual revelation, and through them, he explored the nature of human faith and his ambiguity toward his own resurfacing Jewish identity. That search for a Jewish identity is given primacy over the question of faith in Nickler\\'s production for the Vienna State Opera in 2006. Nickler created a tensely charged atmosphere absent in other productions by casting the characters and chorus as Holocaust survivors. The resulting severity of the staging, costume design, and lighting pulls the viewer\\'s attention to the words and forces one to choose between Moses\\'s direction of faith and singularity outside of culture and Aron\\'s path toward assimilation, which ultimately, according to this production, leads to death. Unfortunately, the power of Nickler\\'s production choice is broken by the over-the-top nature of his staging of the act 2 centerpiece, Der Tanz um das goldene Kalb. The chorus of Jews assimilates into an Ayran culture by donning blond wigs and gold costumes to fall prostrate before a giant, golden \"ICH,\" while Aron instructs them to \"worship yourself in this image.\" The use of pictures of the chorus\\'s faces and a bank of giant television monitors is innovative and jarring, but undercuts the immediacy of Moses\\'s challenge by reducing it to spectacle. By the time Moses returns to the stage with the Ten Commandments, and the original production design resurfaces, the flow of Schoenberg\\'s argument is lost. Any production of Moses und Aron must contend with the lack of a final act; this production wisely chose to end with act 2. However, the DVD release includes the fascinating special feature of Franz Grundheber, who is mesmerizing as Moses, reading the final words of Schoenberg\\'s libretto for act 3. …', 'year': 2008}, {'paperId': 'b19d61afe4bdc923b4e60850f26ff79dd6310483', 'title': 'L’infinie solitude du rescapé', 'abstract': 'To retake, in these few pages, the journey of encounter with the Tutsi genocide in Rwanda – a long journey of listening and writing that still goes on – means, above all, a new opportunity to convey the voices of survivors such as Marie, Esther, Theophila... among others.

One reason it fell short of its nefarious goal was the work of brave non-Jews who sheltered their fellow citizens. In most countries under German control, those who rescued Jews risked imprisonment and death. In Poland, home to more Jews than any other country at the start of World War II and location of six German-built death camps, the punishment was immediate execution. This book tells the stories of Polish Holocaust survivors and their rescuers. The authors traveled extensively in the United States and Poland to interview some of the few remaining participants before their generation is gone. Tammeus and Cukierkorn unfold many stories that have never before been made public: gripping narratives of Jews who survived against all odds and courageous non-Jews who risked their own lives to provide shelter. These are harrowing accounts of survival and bravery. Maria Devinki lived for more than two years under the floors of barns. Felix Zandman sought refuge from Anna Puchalska for a night, but she pledged to hide him for the whole war if necessary - and eventually hid several Jews for seventeen months in a pit dug beneath her house. Through some twenty stories like these, Tammeus and Cukierkorn show that even in an atmosphere of unimaginable malevolence, individuals can decide to act in civilized ways. Some rescuers had antisemitic feelings but acted because they knew and liked individual Jews. In many cases, the rescuers were simply helping friends or business associates. The accounts include the perspectives of men and women, city and rural residents, clergy and laypersons - even children who witnessed their parents' efforts. These stories show that assistance from non-Jews was crucial, but also that Jews needed ingenuity, sometimes money, and most often what some survivors called simple good luck.

Engaging in life review at the end of life, he argued, was good for the patient, mostly in terms of morale and sense of identity. Yet all of life is punctuated by stories, some more beneficial than others. At every stage narratives can prepare people for the future or steel them to bear the troubles and routines of the present. Moreover, these stories can disclose other folkways or recall past events that otherwise would be denied or forgotten. Ordinarily these tales offer a positive message. They provide a perspective on the future radier than a dread of things to come. Still others reveal the possibilities of regeneration. From them we learn about individuals who have not only survived trauma but learned to flourish far from the land of their birth. With varying degrees of accuracy at every stage of life, narratives can prepare us for the imagined future.1 These reflections were brought home to me a few weeks before Christmas 2002. Our grandson, Anders, went into tiie hospital with R.S.V., a respiratory disease about which I knew nothing. Realizing that daycare was hardly the place for him to recuperate, I rushed out to St. Paul to help him through the crisis. The last time I'd had full-time responsibility for a baby was more than thirty years past. Not surprisingly, I gained a new respect for the potential of television, a lesson mothers learn very quickly. Being eight months old, Anders was too young for books unless they were chewable. So in the afternoons to break the monotony of life outside of daycare, we watched the screen together. He liked such programs on Public Television as Arthur, Sagwa, the Chinese Siamese Cat, and Clifford. Upon reflection I realized that he was being exposed to new cultures and to a slightly different age group. The cats, dogs, and monkeys in Sagwa were older and more independent than our infant, and Amy Tan's line drawings represented a Chinese culture of days gone by. The program reminded me of stories set in China that I had read as a child and of how fascinating the unfamiliar settings had been. Arthur and Clifford were American tales, but the children were once again older than our grandchild. All of these programs held out hope that his next stage of development was worth anticipating, for a world existed far beyond his temporary limitations. Children's books, however, are not the only ones to anticipate the next stage of life. For example, Connie Goldman's (2002) Gifts of Caregiving presents a bearable picture of the dfuture to midlife adults whose relatives arc beginning to fail. Fortunately, Goldman's interviews with people taking care of demented or frail relatives demonstrate the positive rewards of this task as well as the difficulties. One may have to sacrifice time, effort, and money, but most of the people Goldman talked to mentioned the benefits of their new roles. Such stories are useful to sustain morale when one is faced with similar challenges. The memory of these narratives could help us persist long enough to find the potential rewards for ourselves. Other stories teach us about past events that might be denied or forgotten. Some of these recollections, especially narratives of the Holocaust, are especially difficult for those who endured wartime atrocities. For example, spring 2002 I interviewed an 85-year-old Holocaust survivor named Gertrude Kupfer (2002) in Richmond, Virginia. Over a period of hours she described her experience as a slave laborer. By talking to me she hoped to educate an expanding number of people about what really happened to Jews under the Germans. Like most survivors, she is deeply troubled by Holocaust deniers, who claim that few Jews died or were mistreated in the Hitler regime. Moreover, she fears that children will not learn the truth about the past unless she and others like her speak up. …\", 'year': 2003}, {'paperId': 'b2c404f8c3a3f59518e34bbef3aa31aad8d73c81', 'title': \"Memories of Holocaust-related traumatic experiences, sense of coherence, and survivors' subjective well-being in late life: some puzzling findings\", 'abstract': 'Background and Objectives: This study explores the nexus of relationships between memories of Holocaust-related early traumatic events, survivors’ sense of coherence (SOC), and subjective well-being (SWB) in late life.

Today, thanks to recorded interviews and testimonials, many archives and collections exist that are open to researchers of trauma studies, holocaust studies, historians among others. These archives act as vital testimonials for oral history, politics and human rights. As such, they are usually either transcribed, or meticulously indexed. In this project, we look at the nonverbal signals emitted by victims of various traumatic events and seek to render these for novel representations that are capable of representing the trauma without the explicit (and often highly politicized) content. In particular, we propose to detect breathing and silence patterns during the speeches of trauma patients for visualization and sonification. We are hoping to glean into cultural and contextual differences of bodily expression of trauma through automatic processing of thousands of hours of testimonials from all over the world.', 'year': 2019}, {'paperId': 'b4655b37a811bac734b3c1548cdce4ab4618eedf', 'title': 'The Paradox of Well-Being and Holocaust Survivors', 'abstract': 'BACKGROUND: Life satisfaction is a core component of well-being. Across age groups, satisfaction with life was found to be integral to individual mental and physical health. Surprisingly, there appears to be little or no association between age and life satisfaction. Recent longitudinal research suggests that life satisfaction may even increase in late life. This is known as the paradox of well-being. OBJECTIVE: To compare levels of life satisfaction reported by Israeli Holocaust survivors (HS) vis-à-vis other older Israelis and older Canadians. DESIGN: We interviewed 295 HS, 205 other older Israelis, and 335 older Canadians each of whom completed the Life Satisfaction Scale with items measuring both concurrent and retrospective aspects. Separate confirmatory factor analytic models were computed for each group. RESULTS: Overall, levels of life satisfaction were indistinguishable across groups. Both concurrent and retrospective items contributed significantly to measurement of a single latent construct. Yet differences between groups in the latent structure of response to certain scale items emerged. CONCLUSIONS: It may be that HS report high life satisfaction not despite, but because of, experiencing early life trauma, juxtaposing early years with the comparatively good conditions of their lives today.', 'year': 2018}, {'paperId': 'b5a92595d9f3f065597721a740f1225f68a157b5', 'title': 'Museum-Based Teacher Education: Teacher Meaning-Making at a Jewish Heritage Museum', 'abstract': 'MUSEUM-BASED TEACHER EDUCATION: TEACHER MEANING-MAKING AT A JEWISH HERITAGE MUSEUM David Russell Goldberg This study answers the question of what meanings teacher-participants make in Holocaust professional development at a Jewish heritage museum in a mandate state. By understanding these meanings, the educational community can better understand how a particular context and approach influences teacher meaning-making and the ways in which museum teacher education programs shape the learning of participants. Meaningmaking is a process of interpretation and understanding experiences in ways that make sense to each individual teacher. Meanings that are formed may impact teachers’ pedagogic interpretation of the Holocaust, which may in turn shape their instructional practices. This instrumental case study used multiple interviews, observations, surveys and documents to explore the meanings teachers make about the Holocaust from participation in Holocaust professional development at a Jewish heritage museum. Participants in the study included nine teachers from public schools and private Jewish schools and two professional developers from the Museum. Each participant was interviewed three times, and six different professional development programs were observed over a period of six months. Programs typically lasted from one to six days and included a presentation by museum staff, Holocaust experts, and survivors. At any museum, each representation of the Holocaust conveys particular messages and mediates Holocaust history through a particular lens. This study reveals insights about how intended aims are interpreted in Holocaust professional development. Three categories emerged of meanings teachers made, namely (1) the hopeful narrative, (2) identity, and (3) the emotional narrative of the Holocaust. This study contributes to the larger field of professional development by partially filling in an area of missing scholarship on Holocaust professional development. Findings from this study may be used to plan future professional development programs on the Holocaust, as well as on other topics, through a deeper understanding of the meanings teachers make of multiple programs at one site.', 'year': 2012}, {'paperId': 'b6280150bd224c8b9399b1089cb5085a0b0db1db', 'title': 'The Response of the Other Survivors and Press Response to Playing for Time', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2016}, {'paperId': 'b634f2915a73b3e4a60f7167bfcdbff984aab3c1', 'title': 'The role of music in terms of the relationship between Holocaust survivors and their children, the second generation', 'abstract': 'Introduction: Inter-generation interaction is disrupted after major traumatic experience.

(1) \"The killer apes learned nothing from the twin towers of Auschwitz and Hiroshima,\" Spiegelman writes; 9/11 is the \"same old deadly business as usual\" (n. pag.). Produced serially, Spiegelman\\'s No Towers comic strips were too politically incendiary to find wide release in the United States; they were largely published abroad and in New York\\'s weekly Jewish newspaper the Forward. In the Shadow of No Towers powerfully asserts that \"the shadow of a past time [interweaves] with a present time,\" to use Spiegelman\\'s own description of his Pulitzer-prize winning two-volume work Maus: A Survivor\\'s Tale (Spiegelman qtd. in Silverblatt 35). In one telling panel there the bodies of four Jewish girls hanged in World War II dangle from trees in the Catskills as the Spiegel-mans drive to the supermarket in 1979 (figure 1). (2) [FIGURE 1 OMITTED] The persistence of the past in Maus, of course, does figure prominently in analyses of the text\\'s overall representational strategies. We see this, for instance, in Dominick LaCapra\\'s reading of the book\\'s \"thematic mode of carnivalization\" (175), Andreas Huyssen\\'s theorizing of Adornean mimesis in Maus, and Alan Rosen\\'s study of Vladek Spiegelman\\'s broken English. (3) Most readings of how Maus represents history approach the issue in terms of ongoing debates about Holocaust representation, in the context of postmodernism, or in relation to theories of traumatic memory. But such readings do not pay much attention to Maus\\'s narrative form: (4) the specificities of reading graphically, of taking individual pages as crucial units of comics grammar. The form of Maus, however, is essential to how it represents history. Indeed, Maus\\'s contribution to thinking about the \"crisis in representation,\" I will argue, is precisely in how it proposes that the medium of comics can approach and express serious, even devastating, histories. (5) \"I\\'m literally giving a form to my father\\'s words and narrative,\" Spiegelman observes about Maus, \"and that form for me has to do with panel size, panel rhythms, and visual structures of the page\" (Interview with Gary Groth 105, emphasis in original). As I hope to show, to claim that comics makes language, ideas, and concepts \"literal\" is to call attention to how the medium can make the twisting lines of history readable through form. When critics of Maus do examine questions of form, they often focus on the cultural connotations of comics rather than on the form\\'s aesthetic capabilities--its innovations with space and temporality. (6) Paul Buhle, for instance, claims, \"More than a few readers have described [Maus] as the most compelling of any [Holocaust] depiction, perhaps because only the caricatured quality of comic art is equal to the seeming unreality of an experience beyond all reason\" (16). Where Michael Rothberg contends, \"By situating a nonfictional story in a highly mediated, unreal, \\'comic\\' space, Spiegelman captures the hyperintensity of Auschwitz\" (206), Stephen Tabachnick suggests that Maus may work \"because it depicts what was all too real, however unbelievable, in a tightly controlled and brutally stark manner. …', 'year': 2006}, {'paperId': 'b7a35d744d8be36173bce01f6396ac3184a2924b', 'title': 'Holocaust and Memory: The Experience of the Holocaust and its Consequences, An Investigation Based on Personal Narratives', 'abstract': 'Originally published in Polish to great acclaim and based on interviews with survivors of the Holocaust in Poland, Holocaust and Memory provides a moving description of their life during the war and the sense they made of it.

They include the stories of an outstanding Catholic priest, a former anti-Semitic football hooligan, students, academics and renowned writers. Each generation has confronted a specific Polish environment which shaped their lives. The profiles reveal the particular Polish contradictions in coming to terms with their upbringing.

In a sharp departure from the past, many Poles are expressing a deep, sympathetic interest in the phenomenon of emerging Jews by flocking to Jewish museums and cultural festivals.

One of the greatest challenges faced by the international community was the fate of the refugees, those people who for various reasons could not or did not want to return to their pre-war homeland. An especially significant place within this category was taken by the Holocaust survivors – the last remnants of the ten million strong pre-war Eastern and Central European Jewish community. The relief effort undertaken in helping this group, by mid-1947 numbering around 250,000 people, was a task of unprecedented scale and difficulty. Among the challenges of that time, the education of children and adolescents was of particular importance. Military authorities, non-governmental organizations (both Jewish and non-Jewish) and finally the survivors, all devoted themselves to helping those who lost their childhood and youth in concentration camps, forced labour and in hiding. This article will discuss this issue through the case-study of the Organization for Rehabilitation and Training (ORT) and its undertakings among Jewish refugees in Great Britain. ORT was set up in Russia in St. Petersburg in 1880 as the Society for the Promotion of Trades and Agriculture among the Jews in Russia, a philanthropic organization designed to assist Jewish artisans, workers and cooperatives, by providing them with cheap credit and establishing vocational schools.1 After World War I, ORT expanded into Eastern Central Europe, France and Germany and by the mid-1930s, despite growing anti-Jewish legislations, organized a comprehensive network of trade schools responding to the needs of the Jewish community. The British branch of ORT, set up in 1921, focused for the first years of its existence on fundraising and propaganda. This situation changed abruptly on 29 August 1939, two days before the outbreak of World War II as 104 teenage students and seven teachers from the ORT school in Berlin left Charlottenburg Station on a train heading for London. The school in Berlin (Private jüdische Lehranstalt für handwerkliche und gewerbliche Ausbildung auswanderungswilliger Juden der ORT Berlin), located at Siemensstrasse 15, was one of ORT’s most significant undertakings in the interwar period and a major centre offering vocational training to Jewish youth.2 The school was opened in 1937 as an answer to * Awarded her PhD in history at Royal Holloway, University of London in 2010.

I would like to thank Rachel Bracha and colleagues from the World ORT Archive in London for their help with gathering material for this article. 2 For more on the ORT school in Berlin, see Monica Lowenberg, “The Education of the Cologne Jawne Gymnasium Children and the Berlin ORT School Boys in Germany and England”, German-speaking Exiles in Great ‘A CONSTRUCTIVE FORM OF HELP’ (KATARZYNA PERSON) 85 the rapidly escalating anti-Semitic Nazi policy limiting educational opportunities for young German Jews.3 The Nazi authorities allowed for it to open on the understanding that it would train only Jews who were planning to emigrate, and could confirm that, in order to safeguard its equipment from confiscation, all machinery and tools used in the school officially would belong to the British ORT. Under the protection of the British Government the school remained the only Jewish institution which functioned unaffected by the Kristallnacht, and indeed by late 1938 had enrolled 215 students, offering 3-year courses to adolescents aged 15 to 17 and 18-month training courses to adult students. Yet with the persecution intensifying and the spectre of war looming on the horizon, the leadership of the school decided to ensure the safety of the students by relocating to Great Britain. After negotiations with the British Ministry for Labour and the Home Office, as well as the Gestapo, it was agreed to move the school, together with all its equipment, to Leeds. The transfer, carried out by Colonel J.H. Levey of British ORT, was prepared by ORT together with OSE (Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants – the Organization to Save the Children). As already mentioned, the first group of students (without the equipment, which at the last moment was confiscated by the Nazis) left Berlin on 29 August. The second group, headed by the director of the school, Werner Simon, was scheduled to leave on 3 September 1939. Neither Simon, nor the boys, ever made it out of Berlin. Almost all of them were later murdered in the Holocaust. The 104 teenage boys who reached London on the outbreak of the war could not have anticipated the fate that awaited their families left behind in Germany. Most of those who were in the transport recalled their relocation as a great adventure. It is clear however that parents saying their goodbyes at the station and those who welcomed them in Great Britain were fully aware of the gravity of the situation and, as one of the boys remembered, the group was met in London by weeping Jewish women from the East End.4 As the school in Leeds was not yet prepared for their reception, the boys and their teachers were first accommodated in the Kitchener reception camp at Sandwich, Kent, which housed about 4,000 German and Austrian refugees. Already in November, however, the first group was transferred to Leeds. ORT’s leaflet ‘From Despair to Hope: A Constructive Form of Help’, devoted to the work of the Technical Engineering School in Leeds, recalled its beginnings: A technical school should first be planned and then constructed. In the case of the ORT school there was no time, no money, and no material available for such a project. After a long and arduous search, the most suitable building that could be found, with a floor area of about 12,000 square feet, was rented. It is situated about a mile from the residential hostels. Tools, equipment, and machinery were purchased, and the students, under the guidance of the instructors (all from Berlin), installed the machinery, connected it with the electric power supply, and made all fittings possible in the workshop of the school. The students of the plumbing and sanitary section of the school erected lavatories, wash-houses etc., and within a short time the school was at work.5 Britain: The Yearbook of the Research Centre for German and Austrian Exile Studies 2 (Amsterdam; Atlanta, G.A.: Rodopi, 2000), 82–83. 3 For more on this, see Solomon Colodner, Jewish Education in Germany under the Nazis (New York: Jewish Education Committee Press, 1964). 4 World ORT Archive (WOA) D04a010, Hans W.

It was divided into five departments: (1) Welding, Turning and Fitting, (2) Sanitary Engineering, (3) Electrical Engineering, (4) Mechanical Engineering, (5) Carpentry and Joinery. There was also a market-gardening section, which organized six-month courses under the supervision of an agricultural director from Palestine. All lessons in school were to be conducted in English, even though, as one of the students remarked on leaving the school, ‘as the Masters are really too busy and old, they cannot be expected to pick up the language as easily as young people.’6 One day of the five day school week was allotted to theoretical classes in mathematics and science. More advanced students also attended classes in the Leeds School of Technology. Students who arrived from Berlin, referred to as the ‘old boys’, continued the studies which they had begun in Germany, but in time the school also began admitting new students, both girls and boys, aged fifteen to eighteen. These were mainly teenage refugees from Eastern and Central Europe who arrived as part of the Kindertransport.7 The majority of students resided in one of five hostels in the school vicinity, each housing 25 to 30 students and staff members of the school. In charge of each hostel was a hostel master responsible for the discipline and conduct of the students. There were two to six students in each room sleeping on bunk beds, with a room leader responsible for rules and regulations being carried out. The school was run by its director, Colonel Levey, with military precision. Students woke up at 6.00 am (6.30 in the winter), and classes lasted from 8.30 am till 12.30 pm and again from 1.30 pm till 4.00 pm. All students had to be back in their rooms by 10.00 pm. Most equipment in the school was constructed by the students, who also did all the redecoration in the building and took turns cleaning the school premises on Sunday mornings.8 The school had a decidedly Jewish character. It was closed on all Jewish holidays and on Sabbath and all food served was strictly kosher. However, as the ORT booklet made clear, the institution was ‘a Technical School and not a religious educational establishment’9 and students were free to carry out whatever religious observance they wished. Attendance in the synagogue was not compulsory and while students were able to participate in Jewish education classes, these were also not compulsory. There was no religious instruction held in the hostels.10 At the same time, the small group of Orthodox students from among the school community was given full support in religious observance and allowed to build a small synagogue on the school’s premises.11 There is no doubt that the leadership of the school placed great importance on the wellbeing of the students. Students were provided with facilities to practice indoor and outdoor sports; there was a student theatre, orchestra and a choi', 'year': 2013}, {'paperId': 'bb03d90a06f7c0ef27fc90fb6c75267bef050fd7', 'title': 'Translating for Rebutting: Paratextual Framing in the Chinese Translations of The Rape of Nanking', 'abstract': 'The Nanking Massacre is one of the most horrendous of its kind, committed by Japanese army in 1937 in the then China‘s capital, Nanking.

Such questions, seemingly confined to the immediate context of the research, put into play deeper issues, such as the dispute over the symbolic power, as reflected by the assertion of a certain public image of the so-called \"Holocaust survivor\", through a struggle of different points of view with regard to the war and regimes of authenticity.

Over the past six decades the voice of the Holocaust survivor has become increasingly audible, and has been instrumental in establishing a public memory of the Holocaust in Australia. Today, survivors are at the forefront of the commemorative activities and their individual stories, representing a myriad of different experiences, are central to Holocaust education. At present the issue that confronts the Sydney Jewish community is no different from the questions facing other communities. How is memory of the Holocaust to be kept alive and vibrant as survivors’ voices begin to recede and as the past passes from ‘living memory to history’? This article is based on group interviews conducted with Holocaust survivors living in Sydney, Australia and explores how these Holocaust survivors would like the Holocaust to be remembered in the future. From the discussion groups it was clear that most of these survivors are unsure if the next generation possesses the inclination and ability not only to remember the Holocaust, but to remember it well. There was a clear sentiment amongst all the groups that one of the only ways the memory of the Holocaust can survive is by being cast as a religious act, duty and obligation, to be codified in the Jewish religious calendar.', 'year': 2007}, {'paperId': 'bd7e78356ce0386078991bb55886f7d59b5fdf58', 'title': 'Guerrilla War in the Mountains: Experiences of Jewish Fighters in the Slovak National Uprising and Partisan Resistance', 'abstract': 'ABSTRACT This article aims to bring forward first-person life stories and reflections of “ordinary” Jewish Holocaust survivors who took part in the Slovak resistance during World War II.

Drawing from archival sources and new interviews, it asserts that residents of the Jewish ghettos were obliged to marshal a full range of creative responses. Survival depended on success as an economic, political and social actor. Evidence for this adaptability supports Yehuda Bauer’s emphasis on ‘amidah’ and confirms his assertion that Holocaust victims did not meet their fate passively. As the survivors from Tarnow and Piotrokow attest, ghetto residents formed strong dyadic social bonds that functioned to guarantee physical and emotional survival. By extending this initial analysis through comparison with Lachwa, one of the few ghettos that saw collective resistance, we can observe how individual survival mechanisms interacted with leadership and community variables. The Jews of Lachwa pursued strategies similar to those seen in Tarnow and Piotrokow. The unique variable at Lachwa which led to broad-based resistance was the structural advantage of a small, easily manageable village which facilitated the transition from individual survival strategies to collective action at a crucial moment.', 'year': 2010}, {'paperId': 'be5cb1eb72d26c8705dd7ba05a0e988074992135', 'title': 'CHILDREN AND WAR ~ The Children Accuse ( Poland , 1946 ) : Between Exclusion from and Inclusion into the Holocaust Canon', 'abstract': 'In 1946 the Jewish Historical Commission in Cracow published the first collection of the early postwar testimonies of Jewish children in Poland Dzieci Oskarzaja (The Children Accuse).[1] The book consists of fifty-five children’s testimonies and fifteen adult testimonies. The latter testimonies focus on children’s experiences in various ghettos in Nazi-occupied Poland, whereas the children’s testimonies are divided into six thematic sections: the ghettos, the camps, on the Aryan side, in hiding, the resistance and prison. The children testimonies can be characterized as ‘unliterary,’ simple descriptive reports, close in time to the events they describe. They convey diversity of individual experiences, but at the same time they all revolve around common themes and shared wartime experiences. They all are based on oral interviews with child survivors that were conducted according to the official guidelines on how to research Jewish children’s wartime experiences that was issued in 1945 by the Historical Commission of the Central Committee of Polish Jews.[2] These interviews were carried out in Jewish children’s orphanages, dormitories, and places of daily care that were established in various Polish cities and towns immediately after the end of war. In 1996 the British publisher Vallentine Mitchell published The Children Accuse in English in the series the Library of Holocaust Testimonies.[3] In the publisher’s announcement the book was depicted as ‘a most unusual book.’ This phrase may well illustrate the difficulty of assessing its value as a documentary source in the Holocaust canon.', 'year': None}, {'paperId': 'befb0c2d85536d6a9f05d64ab7ccf9d81ed5a6f0', 'title': 'Saul Bellow and the holocaust moment', 'abstract': 'The post-Holocaust decades of the 1940s and1950s found Saul Bellow a relatively inexperienced writer, still passionately committed to idealistic humanistic agendas, and unconvinced that utopian radical politics held the answer to mankind\\'s ills. As his left-leaning political idealism faded, he withdrew from the Parlisan Review crowd, beginning his move toward the entrenched conservatism he is now either vilified or praised for. His goal was not only to make his mark on American letters, but to make it in the international arena as well. His two abiding goals were to mount a passionate defense of the human creature and simultaneously supplant the monumental, skeptical, modernist naysayer Ernest Hemingway. He rode into American literary history on the tidal wave of the \"Jewish Decades,\" the 1950s, which breached forever the WASP hegemony in American letters. Along with his cadre, he was greeted with a pejorative designation: \"Jewish-American ethnic writer,\" not \"American writer.\" Already disaffiliated from his Jewishness by his unhappy family life, he further disaffiliated himself from this parochial put-down. Perhaps he even wondered if writing about the Holocaust, still a \"Jewish\" topic in the minds of many, might further \"ethnicize\" him in the eyes of the international literary community. Bellow\\'s subsequent mea culpas for his early disaffiliation from Judaism and for his failure to write about the Holocaust sooner are now a matter of historical record. These admissions lie scattered throughout his post-1970s essays, lectures, interviews, family conversations, and fiction, which, taken together, represent a genuine atonement. The spiritual integrity of this process was such that it precluded his offering further explanations. In this essay, I want to historicize, complicate, and dignify the issue of Bellow\\'s writerly delay by examining the atmosphere that prevailed during the immediate post-Holocaust decades of Bellow\\'s 1940s and \\'50s literary debut and by revisiting Bellow\\'s own psychological and metaphysical journey. From the vantage point of the 1960s, many commentators accused American Jews of having been impotent in the face of National Socialism, ground down by the trenchantly anti-Semitic Roosevelt-State-Department America, lacking in social cohesion, and generally too comfortable in the suburbs. Other commentators accused American Jews of religious disunity, stunned disbelief, and undue discouragement over the failure of the 1938 Evian conference to facilitate Jewish refugees. Nativism flourished--even Chinese immigrants, previously denied any rights to citizenship, were now more desirable American citizens than Jews. Organized boycotts of German goods, people argued, were too little too late. Even the Zionist movement stood accused of weak leadership and fracturing from within. Judaic humanism, now thought by some to have been overly idealist in the face of the Holocaust, could not guarantee a rational future for Jews after Auschwitz. From the vantage point of the 1960s, Leon Jick wrote his influential essay \"The Holocaust--Its Uses and Abuses in the American Public,\" claiming that \"American Jewry sought to forget,\" and had rendered the Holocaust a \"barely remembered, rarely mentioned event, of interest only to survivors\" (308-09). Edward Shapiro in A Time for Healing: American Jewry since World War II, reported that \"there was relatively little discussion among American Jews about the fate of European Jewry\" (5), and Gerald Sorin claimed there had been a conspiracy of silence (217). By the 1970s, Jack Wertheimer insisted that the problem was not so much moral abdication and amnesia as the fact that \"the trauma of the Holocaust [was] buried in the American Jewish psyche [and took a very long time to] erupt into public consciousness\" (7). Edward Alexander further lamented that \"the American Jewish community was simultaneously the most powerful and powerless in the world, and that it had tragically abnegated responsibility for its brethren at the crucial moment\" (122). …', 'year': 2007}, {'paperId': 'bf07416011610dee046b6de191fbe1160b1ba9f7', 'title': 'Rolf Dieter Brinkmanns Fifties.

In place of historical photographs and footage it offers present-day geography. Guided by on-screen interviews with survivors, witnesses, and perpetrators, nine and a half hours of \"traveling shots\" and \"pans\" repeatedly traverse a small number of sites: former extermination camps in Poland and their surrounds, highways in Germany, railway stations, fields and rivers where atrocities occurred or were planned. These shots replace the piles of bodies, bulldozed and filmed by liberating armies, that comprise the \"raw\" material of many other films of the Holocaust. Shoah\\'s refusal to visualize the past has inspired thoughtful reflection on the limits of representation, the problematics of witnessing, and the presence of the past through its traces in individual hearts and the industrial world.3 Some readings have also touched on the places of the past, not lieux de me\\'moire, or repositories of the past, but charged pieces of earth where the events happened.4 These places of memory constitute the \"geographe\" of Lanzmann\\'s film. These are not the only places in Shoah, however. While the images consistently refer the survivor\\'s narratives back to the places where they occurred, Lanzmann painstakingly situates most of the interviews themselves in the far-flung places where the interviewees found refuge, chiefly Israel and the United States. Furthermore, the film itself has a place of enunciation, a place from which it emanates. The literature on Shoah has devoted little attention to the places from which the survivors return to their past, and still less to the place of Shoah the film. In part this neglect may be due to the immensity of the film, its length a metaphor for the immensity of the event itself. Difficult to grasp as a whole, Shoah, like a novel, invites one to look at it piecemeal, to analyze its motifs and its characters. Yet also like a novel, Shoah has a plot, and its plot relates not only to the places of the Holocaust but also to the places of enunciation.

As a sociologist, native Belgian, and Holocaust survivor, Suzanne Vromen is perhaps the perfect person to author a study of the Jewish children hidden by Belgian nuns during the Holocaust. Drawing on detailed interviews conducted with eight nuns, one priest, twenty-nine survivors who were hidden as children, and two lay individuals who escorted the children from their families to their hiding places, she both corroborates other findings about the child victims of the Holocaust and provides new understandings of their rescuers. In the book’s introduction, the author tells her own story of Holocaust survival. It therefore seems appropriate to mention it at the beginning of this review as well. Along with her immediate family, Vromen fled Nazi-occupied Belgium in 1941 for what was then known as the Belgian Congo, where she attended school in a convent. As she writes of her experiences, “I distinctly remember my initial bewilderment at being plunged suddenly into a Catholic milieu. I also recall how I eventually made my peace with the atmosphere of spirituality and the intense socialization that characterize convents” (p. 1). Vromen’s background is relevant because it speaks to her abilities to contextualize her interview data. Indeed, she draws fruitfully on her experiences (which included a teaching stint at her school upon graduation) in her analysis, and is therefore able to approach the findings thoughtfully and objectively. The book’s title and subtitle are somewhat misleading, as together they imply that the book focuses mainly on the nuns. In fact, a detailed chapter on the nuns is presented along with equally rich chapters on the hidden children and on the lay rescuers. A fourth chapter devoted to collective memory and the commemoration of the rescue activities rounds out the analysis. Title aside, the book’s structure is appropriate, as Vromen’s analysis makes it clear that one cannot fully understand the hidden children’s experiences without taking into account the experiences of the nuns and the other resisters, as well as the broader institutional context in which they operated. The substantive chapters offer individual accounts that in many ways defy a simple summary. The convents in which the children were hidden differed in terms of number of children housed as well as resources available to care for them. The children’s experiences varied further depending on their age, gender, and whether or not they were placed with a sibling. The children also experienced a range of reactions to their rescuers: while many responded positively to aspects of the Catholic religion and developed feelings of love and gratitude toward the nuns who sheltered them, others recalled nuns who either harmed them physically with corporal punishment or emotionally by humiliating them for unacceptable', 'year': 2012}, {'paperId': 'c354695ea3192b1a792171f02871143f0b795a7e', 'title': 'Holocaust Remembrance: Making Meaning through Oral History across the Generations', 'abstract': 'in English (300 words): Our university writing course, “Visual Media and Holocaust Narrative,” brings students closer to the Holocaust through affective engagement with the stories of survivors. With its informative and performative properties, video testimony engages the intellect and emotions of the students and reveals the dignity and humanity of the interviewees. The course requires writing a proposal for a film based on the lives of the survivors as well as creating a short promotional trailer made as a digital story. Preparatory assignments include archiving work for the oral history project, reading and discussing theoretical texts, watching and discussing Holocaust films, and writing an analytical essay. After this, students work with a partner to create the film proposal. Before doing research about the historical context of the idea, location and events they choose, we offer library workshops to teach them how to find and evaluate reliable sources. We also require a 2-unit media lab, the first part devoted to learning the technologies to capture web multimedia resources, to create audio and enhanced podcasts, and to write and produce digital stories. The second is devoted to creating their own trailers. We end with a public symposium presenting the student work. It is evident that the students become personally committed to their work, and that the ideas they grapple with at each step enrich their overall learning. They engage in deep learning and develop insights about oral history, Holocaust survivors, the challenges of making accurate Holocaust films, and the Holocaust itself. Using the oral histories as the center of the course grounds the work in a profound way. Our students’ work is also significant for the survivors who have given testimony, as many of them find satisfaction in their stories being used to educate and take action to prevent future genocide. Goodman, Gradowski, Saldinger IOHA 2010 1 Holocaust Remembrance: Making Meaning through Oral History across the Generations “The first-hand experience of trying to take a person’s story and turn it into a compelling movie was extremely difficult. However, I think it becomes fun and interesting because of the passion that you develop for your survivor’s story. After hearing Rebecca’s story, I immediately wanted other people to hear her unbelievable experiences. Creating the film proposal allowed me to feel as though I would be able to get her story out to the world.” (Santa Clara University student) Oral history has come to play a pivotal role in educating about the Holocaust and about the social preconditions and far-reaching consequences of war. As we attempt to understand and remember in the post-Holocaust generation and beyond, we face the challenge of constructing ways for ensuring a continued legacy. This paper describes a creative approach for bringing students closer to the tragic event that is receding in memory – bringing them closer through affective, emotional engagement with the powerful life stories of Holocaust survivors. The quote above comes from one of the students in the Santa Clara University upper-division writing course, “Visual Media and Holocaust Narrative.” We will explain the underlying pedagogy we have developed, which we believe leads to students gaining insight into the implications and meanings of the Holocaust. We will illustrate that a high level of learning is taking place and that the students’ work reflects a deeper than usual level of understanding and an integration of various kinds of learning. The learning is inherently active and, for most students, powerfully transformative. In Lynn E. Swaner’s words, “they begin to question, test, and reformulate” their old ways of making meaning and “their views of themselves and the world in which they live” (18). We think this course, which uses Holocaust testimonies as an experiential teaching tool, is an effective model that others might consider adopting. Oral history video testimony is a powerful teaching resource in an increasingly audiovisual culture. It is also a stimulus for research. With its informative as well as performative properties, Holocaust video testimony engages both the intellect and emotions of the students and reveals the dignity and humanity of the interviewees. It is a compelling way to intensify the immediacy of history as it comes alive in the context of a person’s life. The difference lays in the detailed, in-depth story, including the emotion that is visible in the survivor’s voice, expression, and even the silences. These stories do not present a stereotype of a victim, but rather a survivor, often a warm grandparent figure in his or her own home, one who has an incredible story to tell. As scholars in many disciplines recognize, narrative is powerful and important. As one of our students wrote, “it is hard to separate oneself from Goodman, Gradowski, Saldinger IOHA 2010 2 tragedy after uncovering a lost story.” Reflecting the experience of many of the students, another said: “learning from oral history is completely different from reading a textbook.” Because survivors are aging, and each year fewer are able to travel and speak personally to classes, it is often their videotaped oral histories that now fulfill the mission of education and public memory. Students are often amazed by the dignity of the survivors and the calm and poised way in which they tell their stories. They are also intrigued by both the amount and the subtlety of new information they learn. One student wrote: “Before I did the work in this class, I hadn’t viewed the communities of Jewish victims as a complex layering of actions and reactions that we normally associate with the idea of community. I just lumped them all together as human beings that were reduced to shadows of their former selves.” By listening closely, finding powerful passages, and identifying key motifs and locations in the oral histories, students were compelled to think deeply about the essence of one person’s experience and what he or she hoped to share with the world. Interestingly, students often reflected on their own families and values, which we think speaks to this very personal kind of learning and to the fact that the stories that emerge from oral history have the potential to help students recognize commonalities, bridge differences, and ensure continuity through generations. In the surveys they filled out, 100% of our students said that watching the tape gave them a “better understanding of the experience of a Holocaust survivor,” and 100% said they responded “on a personal level to watching the tape.” Many grew fond of their subject (referring to “my person” in class discussions), and some became passionate advocates for them. One student was especially moved when he realized that his survivor had been only 19 years old when he joined the Polish resistance, that he was “younger than I am now.” The empathic engagement with the subject through oral history often leads to a transformative experience. As one student wrote: “I came out of this class immensely more aware of myself as a person. Learning about the Holocaust and hearing, reading, and watching the experiences of survivors really helped to put my life in context. . . . Often times I get caught up in the daily grind and all of the stresses of life, and I forget just how lucky I am to be healthy, safe, and loved. These are three things this class has taught me never to take for granted.” In a way, the students also feel entrusted with the survivor’s oral histories and obligated to hold their stories and pass them on. As another student wrote, “I feel connected to the people whose interviews I watched, and I feel like I am one of the few people who can pass on their stories – even [if] just to my family and friends. I can bear witness to what they went through, even though no one can ever know exactly what it felt like. Also, I Goodman, Gradowski, Saldinger IOHA 2010 3 can remind people of specific things that happened and describe some of what the people went through – when they need to remember.” We had a number of specific goals when we began developing this course, and it is important to note that the thinking and talking took place over many years and always in collaboration with each other and several other colleagues. Our goals were to use the oral histories more fully than we did in previous courses we had taught in order to create an opportunity for deeper learning, to enhance the experiential and community-based learning components of the course, and to fulfill the mandate of the new Santa Clara University core curriculum by adding a new media component. We also wanted to create a more sophisticated research assignment, one that demands more student engagement and cognitive complexity: higher-order thinking skills (analysis, synthesis, and creativity as well as an opportunity to teach others about what they have learned). The course focus on the intersection of film and first-hand accounts of the Holocaust appeals to undergraduates. It is grounded in the Holocaust testimonies, and the major project, the writing assignment that shapes the course, is a proposal for a documentary film based on the lives of the survivors whose oral histories the students work on. Their film can be about the survivor’s war experience generally, or focused more narrowly on some event or segment of his or her life. In pairs, using their oral histories as primary sources, the students decide on a focus and theme, do the research, and write the proposal. In other words, the primary material itself takes the students in various directions, and together with their partner, they must determine their own research path. To go along with their proposals, we ask the students to create a 2.5-minute promotional trailer – a digital story made using multimedia resources, which we will explain later. The film proposal and trailer could not be done without a ', 'year': 2010}, {'paperId': 'c3ed684df449a651464c24ee603fb5928f2444be', 'title': \"Arendt's testimony: Judging in a Lawless World\", 'abstract': \"I was really of the opinion that Eichmann was a buffoon. I'll tell you this: I read the transcript of his police investigation, thirty-six hundred pages, read it, and read it very carefully, and I do not know how many times I laughed--laughed out loud! People took this reaction in a bad way. I cannot do anything about that. But I know one thing. Three minutes before certain death, I probably still would laugh. And that, they say, is the tone of voice. That the tone of voice is predominantly ironic is completely true. The tone of voice in this case is really the person. Hannah Arendt (1) Hannah Arendt's laughter has long rung hollow in the ears of many commentators on the Eichmann trial. The ironic tone of Arendt's controversial reports on the trial, Eichmann in Jerusalem (1963), her critics claim, is a mode of defence; a cold-hearted carapace of bitter reason thrown up against the atrocious history of unbearable suffering dramatised in the 62 days of harrowing witness testimony that made the 1961 Jerusalem trial unique in the history of war crime trials. As Idith Zertal has argued recently, however, it was not--or at least not only--the suffering of Holocaust survivors per se that Arendt was distancing herself from in pre-1967 Jerusalem, but the sanctification of that suffering within an emerging politics of Israeli nationhood. In Zertal's unsettling history of the vexed relation between trauma, grief, collective memory and national politics in Israel, Arendt's deliberate irreverence deconstructs a national mythology that did not so much deliver justice to Holocaust victims--'as if justice could be rendered', writes Zertal of Prime Minister, David Ben Gurion's presentation of the Eichmann trial as an uniquely expiatory event in the history of Israel--as set extraordinarily difficult cultural and political terms on the representation of that justice itself. (2) In this essay, I want to suggest that Arendt's refusal to inhabit a rhetoric of traumatic testimony--a refusal that differs so strikingly from the tone of much contemporary memoir writing--connects Eichmann in Jerusalem with her larger project to think about judgement in the 1960s and 1970s. For Arendt, the Prosecution's emphasis on 'what the Jews had suffered, not on what Eichmann had done', in her words, was questionable politically, but could not be further from what she thought should have been the trial's main business: the risky, necessary and exhilarating legal, moral and philosophical task of defining new terms for judgement after the Shoah. (3) For Arendt, Eichmann the buffoon was the disturbingly vacuous correlative for the moral void left by Nazi history. Finding him funny was part of what it meant to judge him. If one can somehow be one's own irony, as Arendt later suggested in the interview with Gunter Gaus cited above, if irony turns out to be a kind of kernel of the historical and remembering self and not merely a protective shell, it is perhaps because the ironic voice positions the subject in a distinctive relation to historical injury--not only as a suffering, but as a political, moral and, crucially in Arendt's later writing on judgement, thinking witness. I GREY CATS One of the paradoxes of the Eichmann trial was that while nobody really doubted that the defendant was guilty, the guilt of others not in the glass box dominated discussion of it. From Eichmann's ludicrous self-aggrandising claims that his death would serve as an example to all future anti-semites and at the same time relieve Germany's youth of its guilt complex, to Ben Gurion's, 'We want the nations of the world to know [...] and they should be ashamed'(EinJ, p10), the trial took place in a highly-charged culture of grief and expiation in which Eichmann's guilt was not only a given, but even on occasion an irrelevance. (Ben Gurion again: 'the fate of Eichmann, the person, has no interest for me whatsoever. What is important is the spectacle' (IH, p107). …\", 'year': 2009}, {'paperId': 'c41614e492500722e14f4b0cee57a4704c4f044d', 'title': 'Vicarious Witnessing in European Concentration Camps: Imagining the Trauma of Another:', 'abstract': 'When standing before the historical evidence of a massive trauma such as the Holocaust, people vicariously witness the trauma through photographs, artistic images, survivor stories, and physical artifacts. From this evidence, the mind creates a semblance of the historic event. The effect of this reconstruction involves a powerful experience, whereby people believe that they know something very deeply about the event by living imaginatively through the experiences of another. This phenomenon is the vicarious witnessing experience. This qualitative research project explores the impact of vicarious witnessing during visits to concentration camps in Germany and Poland. Each participant constructed three types of narrative perspectives before, during, and after visiting the camps, including written (travel journals), spoken (interview and conversational dialogues), and visual (photography) texts. In analyzing these texts, the author utilized two types of narrative analyses, interpretive readings and narrative instances. The analysis showed how participants filtered their vicarious witnessing experience through personal, social, and cultural frameworks, created a safe vicarious witnessing experience, and made sense of their experiences through the perspective of their own lives.

Each of these collections has entailed collaborating with a partner outside the university community, as well as faculty within the university, and each has presented a different set of opportunities and challenges. The first example is a collection of videos digitized from VHS tapes, composed of interviews with survivors of the 1939-1945 Holocaust. These are being used as source materials for students, who create themed A/V essays from edited portions of the). The second example is a set of sacramental mission records spanning the 17 to the 19 centuries. This population recorded included indigenous peoples, Spanish residents, and Anglo immigrants. They are being used as source material for students doing historical research on population trends in the area. Best practice/implementation issues include intellectual property, security, digitizing, and metadata. Supporting the curriculum with digital collections Traditionally, libraries have furnished storage and organization of intellectual content, while providing public access to them. In the last couple of decades, though, this role has evolved, largely through the application of emerging technologies in networking, storage, and increasingly user-friendly discovery and retrieval interfaces (Franklin et al., 2006). Now they offer access both onsite and from remote locations, serve as preservation centers by digitizing materials, and disseminate items that they do not house themselves. This ability to organize and consolidate the discovery of materials from many locations has increased their value as centers of research. Digital libraries are a recent product of this evolution. Vannaver Bush was probably the first to predict what we now consider the digital library, in his 1945 article As We May Think, but it wasn't until the 1990s, with the rise of the Internet and the graphical World Wide Web, that serious practical applications of digital libraries developed. The Library of Congress's American Memory (Mission and History, 2009) is an early example of the evolving ability to create a digital library of primary source material. In California, our local consolidation of source items is called Calisphere, a production of the University of California. This service draws content from many venues throughout the state, and is organized to serve K-12 educators, with themed collections, sample lesson plans, and links to further resources (Calisphere, n.d.). While many digital libraries collect and present items of interest to educators, there are ways to expand the usefulness of such libraries. In an AACE symposium in 2006, Franklin et al. discussed how technological support was making it more feasible to provide primary materials for classroom use (Franklin et al., 2006). This presentation will offer examples of how Santa Clara University Library has begun to add this role to its mission. Library/Faculty partnerships Academic libraries have a long history of partnering with faculty in such areas as material selection, information literacy teaching, and topic-focused research training modules. SCU Library, through its Digital Initiatives Department, has begun a different sort of partnering: constructing custom digital collections of digitized primary source materials for course use. Santa Clara is considered as primarily a teaching university, so while the Library has an ongoing commitment to the digital preservation of its archival and special collections materials, it also understands the need to support the teaching mission of the school. Two examples of this support, each with a unique set of opportunities and challenges, are the Holocaust Oral History Project and the Mission Santa Clara Sacramental Records.\", 'year': 2009}, {'paperId': 'c4a61d1c817024d27ea2780c41f7896270bc2597', 'title': 'A Jewish Family in Germany Today: An Intimate Portrait', 'abstract': 'Immediately after the Holocaust, it seemed inconceivable that a Jewish community would rebuild in Germany. What was once unimaginable has now come to pass: Germany is home to one of Europe’s most vibrant Jewish communities, and it has the fastest growing Jewish immigrant population of any country in the world outside Israel. By sharing the life stories of members of one Jewish family—the Kalmans—Y. Michal Bodemann provides an intimate look at what it is like to live as a Jew in Germany today. Having survived concentration camps in Poland, four Kalman siblings—three brothers and a sister—were left stranded in Germany after the war. They built new lives and a major enterprise; they each married and had children. Over the past fifteen years Bodemann conducted extensive interviews with the Kalmans, mostly with the survivors’ ten children, who were born between 1948 and 1964. In these oral histories, he shares their thoughts on Judaism, work, family, and community.

It is powerful because it articulates, for the first time, to my knowledge, a generalized theory of testimony (or of witnessing, and thereby addresses a need which has been felt in the humanities for some time now. Moreover, it applies this theory to a number of critical subject matters: to the historical upheavals by which our age has come increasingly to be defined (principally, the Holocaust), and to a series of post-war manifestations of such change in literature, literary criticism, pedagogical practice, and most recently, film. But it is equally potentially a very dangerous book because, while being very smart, at times dazzling in its insights, it gets things fundamentally wrong. Further, it does so in ways that-quite apart from the potentially hurtful manner in which it presents itself-reproduce the very difficulties it highlights, and at a moment and within an arena where the stakes are particularly high. At the heart of the book is a notion of \"impossible witness.\" The notion derives from Dori Laub\\'s work-as psychoanalytic practitioner, as founder and interviewer of the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies at Yale, and as a child survivor himself of the camps-and refers to the silence that commonly envelopes the Holocaust survivor\\'s voice about the events to which s/he has been cognizant witness, and yet about which they have been unable to speak.

This opening talk is, surprisingly, not about science, which was the intended topic of their dialogue, nor even about Levi's experiences in Auschwitz-Monowitz, but rather about problems of translation, between Hebrew, Greek and Italian, and interpretation of the Bible, from Dante to the Talmud. Levi's perceptive observations about the intricacies of Bible translation and interpretation (a topic that lies at the core and historical origin of translation studies) reminds us that translation was not only a trade he practised, but also a subject he studied and thought about in some depth, part of a large, intense interest in language and language systems in general terms. The conversation with Regge continually navigates between linguistics, etymology and translation (among other topics) and this pattern can be observed throughout his many interviews as well as his own written work.

The teachers set up their classrooms as safe places for learning about genocide as difficult history, yet they did not shield their students from its horrors.

This issue is also compelling as the articles use oral history not only to interrogate the past but also to contemplate contemporary events in the United States and around the world. War and its aftermath is certainly a reality of life in the twenty-first century, and two articles address larger questions of survival, interrogating what that means for veterans and civilians alike. We begin the issue with Alistair Thomson’s “Anzac Memories Revisited,” an article in which Thomson returns to interviews he conducted 30 years ago with an Australian World War One veteran. This insightful article, which draws on these interviews in light of new questions and interpretations since the publication of Thomson’s book Anzac Memories, foregrounds questions of individual and collective memory of war and postwar life, especially trauma and its aftermath. In “(Re)Placing the Past,” Tim Cole explores how geographical space and place in Holocaust survivors’ oral histories. In doing so, he moves beyond obvious ways that narrators recount events through where they physically were in any particular point in time; instead, he suggests that memory allows narrators to employ “strategies of memory” that allow them to navigate the retelling of painful and difficult events in their lives, especially around separation from family and physical or mental violence. Strategic memory is not limited, of course, to wartime survivors. Jennifer Helgren interrogates oral history narratives of a multiracial group of women who grew up in the 1950s and 1960s. How women construct nostalgic recollections of a “very innocent time” when girls participated in single-sex organizations and grew up in more insular communities illuminates gendered notions of safety and respectability, concepts the women in Helgren’s study worked hard to maintain in their lives. What they reveal about their lives as sheltered girls offers nuanced analysis about safety and crime in postwar America, a topic we see repeated in the news with respect to sexual and physical violence against women in the United States and around the world. Ruth Carbonette Yow turns our attention to football culture as the site for battles over racial integration in a Georgia town in the 1960s. A winning football team in 1967 provides the foundation for a dominant narrative of racial harmony, but Yow pushes beyond this narrative to explore black student activism and discord as well as reconciliation. Student protest, Yow argues, exposes a politics of racial justice that needs to be elevated in order to understand not only integration and', 'year': 2015}, {'paperId': 'c88bb69cf688ed9582bdc476056260a4db4ea3a4', 'title': 'Can the past keep life pleasant even for old-old trauma survivors?', 'abstract': 'Objectives: This study examined the relative effect of positive and negative autobiographical aspects in later life as a function of the traumatic experience of the Holocaust and age.

They rated their happiness and suffering during major anchor periods (‘the happiest period’ and ‘the most miserable period’) as well as their life satisfaction. Results: The findings suggest that even after massive trauma and under accelerating decline associated with old-old age, the past can keep life pleasant, as indicated by the stronger association of past happiness, compared to that of past suffering, with life satisfaction. Nevertheless, past suffering was associated with life satisfaction among the Holocaust survivors and manifested a stronger effect among most of the old-old participants.

It examines the experience of sexual violence, as well as the ways this can be understood through the Visual History Archive. I argue that Jewish women were vulnerable to and experienced sexual violence during the Holocaust in different ways depending on the context in which they found themselves. In this thesis, I explore five of these contexts: the initial Nazi occupation period, in ghettos, in the Nazi camp system, in hiding and during flight, and immediately following the liberation. The thesis begins with a theoretical and methodological consideration of the testimonies and how stories of sexual violence are shaped within the interview. In this section, I firstly consider the Visual History Archive, and the ways that the interviews, the interviewers and the systems of the VHA itself have potentially impacted upon and shaped the English-language interviews that discuss sexual violence. I argue that the origins and conceptual framework of the project, and the ways that the interviews were conducted have an impact on how survivors reveal and discuss issues of sexual violence, as well as on the ability of researchers to investigate sexual violence using this archive. Secondly, I consider the way survivors reflect on their decisions to speak about sexual violence. Survivors often discuss remaining silent, or feeling silenced, about their experiences of sexual violence. In the fifty years between the end of the Holocaust and the recording of the interviews, survivors have been thinking about and attempting to make sense of their memories of sexual violence and how it fits within their Holocaust experience and their life story. The way survivors have interpreted and reinterpreted their experiences of sexual violence influences how they tell these stories in their interviews with the Shoah Foundation. In the remainder of the thesis, I analyse the Visual History Archive’s 989 English-language testimonies that discuss sexual violence and explore five specific contexts of vulnerability in detail. In each context, I identify specific patterns within the interview data, including perpetrators, types of abuse and specific geographic location, and consider how Jewish women were vulnerable in different ways at different points in time and in different contexts of the Holocaust. I also consider factors which potentially influenced the vulnerability of Jewish women, such as anti-Jewish legislation, Nazi laws prohibiting sexual relations between so-called ‘Aryans’ and Jews, and rules and hierarchies within the military and the camp systems that dealt effectively or ineffectively with sexual violence. In this section of the thesis, I argue that Jewish women were vulnerable to sexual violence in different ways depending on the Holocaust context. In sum, in this thesis I examine survivors’ English-language narratives about sexual violence, and how these memories inform historians about the vulnerability of Jewish women and female children during the Holocaust. I argue that the circumstances of Nazi persecution of Jews did not always protect Jewish women from sexual assault, as scholars have previously asserted, but rather the conditions of the Holocaust added a specific gendered layer of vulnerability to sexual violence.', 'year': 2016}, {'paperId': 'ca05e09e4d556c2118f2c154a199dcb6f23f0a2a', 'title': 'Exploring the psychological effects of the Holocaust on the second generation : a phenomenological inquiry with children of Holocaust survivors and children of parents who served the Third Reich.', 'abstract': \"EXPLORING THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF THE HOLOCAUST ON THE SECOND GENERATION: A PHENOMENOLOGICAL INQUIRY WITH CHILDREN OF HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS AND CHILDREN OF PARENTS WHO SERVED THE THIRD REICH MAY 1996 SUZANNE BRITA SCHECKER, A.A., SCHOOL FOR LIFE LONG LEARNING, UNIVERSITY SYSTEM OF NEW HAMPSHIRE B.G.S., SCHOOL FOR LIFE LONG LEARNING, UNIVERSITY SYSTEM OF NEW HAMPSHIRE M.Ed., UNIVERSITY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE C.A.G.S., UNIVERSITY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE Ed.D., UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST Directed by: Professor Jack Wideman This dissertation presents the results of a study designed to explore the personal experience of being children of Holocaust survivors or children of parents who served the Third Reich.

Qualitative research was conducted with eight participants, four children of Holocaust survivors, and four children of parents who served the Third Reich. Data from in-depth interviews were grouped into four themes that were common to all the participants; when and how the participants learned about the Holocaust, the effect of this legacy on their personal development during childhood, the impact of the legacy on the participants' chosen professions or work in the world, and the participants' current values and thoughts on spiritual and social issues. Thematic analysis of each category further defined the experience of the participants and offered a data base for emerging implications. The implications include: the need for further study of the effects of war and genocide on the second generation, the need for greater education, and the inclusion of the second generation in treatment of psychological trauma, the need to provide opportunities for the descendants of both sides to speak and have their stories heard in a safe and non-judgmental environment, and the greater concern about the long-term psychological damage of wars, genocide, and group violence on future\", 'year': 1996}, {'paperId': 'cac1c387a37f5812b3e083de2b90f7baf8cb5ae1', 'title': 'extensively from Nazi potentates and officials, not all of his claims are firmly grounded in empirical evidence, as sometimes he has chosen to extrapolate selectively from fragmentary evidence regarding actual cash flows.*', 'abstract': '��� The case of Scherwitz is “extraordinary,” writes Anita Kugler in this fascinating biographical study of the life and times of Fritz Scherwitz, a police and SS official in occupied Latvia who presented himself after the war as a Jewish survivor of the Riga concentration camp.

The arrest of Scherwitz stunned the refugee community, and Scherwitz continued to insist that he was Jewish and had hidden his identity while serving in the police and SS. The true identity of Scherwitz remains a mystery, and many fundamental details will, as Kugler concludes, never be known. While investigating the life story of Scherwitz, Kugler conducted exhaustive archival research in Germany and Latvia, examining materials on the Nazi occupation of Latvia as well as postwar investigative and court records, and interviewing numerous witnesses and survivors. Kugler offers a number of insightful observations on the strengths and weaknesses of the sources, as she takes the reader not only through the life and times of Scherwitz but along on her investigations to find the real man. Even after careful investigative research, Kugler does not know, for example, her subject’s true date or place of birth. Scherwitz gave conflicting information, including four dates of birth, three birthplaces, two nationalities, two religions (or no religion, as he wrote on his SS card), and several variations of his name. After his arrest in 1948, Scherwitz insisted his given name was Eleke, son of Yankel and Sore Sirewitz, and that he was born in 1910 in Vilnius or Siauliai. Kugler’s inquiry to the Lithuanian office of vital statistics for the German, Lithuanian, and Polish spelling of his subject’s name (and those of his parents) came back negative.

Differences in functioning between adult offspring of HS (HSO) and a comparison group, as well as the psychosocial functioning of adolescent grandchildren of HS, were studied. Degree of presence of Holocaust in the family was examined in families in which both parents were HSO, either mother or father was HSO, and neither parent was HSO. Mothers' Holocaust background was associated with higher levels of psychological distress and less positive parenting representations. In line with synergic (multiplicative) models of risk, adolescents in families where both parents were HSO perceived their mothers as less accepting and less encouraging independence, and reported less positive self-perceptions than their counterparts. They also perceived their fathers as less accepting and less encouraging independence, showed higher levels of ambivalent attachment style, and according to their peers, demonstrated poorer adjustment during military basic training than their fellow recruits from the one-parent HSO group. Parents and adolescents in the one-parent HSO group functioned similarly to others with no Holocaust background. Parenting variables mediated the association across generations between degree of Holocaust experience in the family of origin of the parents and ambivalent attachment style and self-perception of the adolescents. It is recommended that researchers and clinicians develop awareness of the possible traces of trauma in the second and the third generation despite their sound functioning in their daily lives.Thanks to the families that participated in this study for their willingness to contribute their time and experience and for sharing with us some of their most precious moments.

New York: Oxford University Press, 2009. 211 pages. Cloth, $74.00. Given that Holocaust survivors\\' stories have been commemorated in novels, plays, and motion pictures, the title of this book may seem, at face value, very familiar. But Approaching an Auschwitz Survivor adopts a distinctive tone and approach in providing narratives about the journey to concentration camps, unbearable camp lives, and death marches. The editor, Jurgen Matthaus, together with four other Holocaust scholars-Konrad Kwiet, Nechama Tec, Atina Grossman, and Wendy Lower--devote their analyses to the testimony of one Holocaust survivor, Helen \"Zippi\\' Tichauer (nee Spitzer). Zippi, as she preferred to be called, was born 1918 in Bratislava and was one of the first 2,000 young, unmarried Jewish women transported to Auschwitz in March 1942 from Slovakia. Spending two and a half years in the camp, she was not only one of the few early arrivals to survive the camp and the death marches, but also still able, through her testimony, to remember crucial aspects of daily camp life. Based on her experience, she is uniquely qualified, even obligated, to bear witness to the horrors of Auschwitz. The book comprises five chapters, each written by one of the five contributing historians, and a conclusion. In the first chapter, \"Designing Survival: A Graphic Artist in Birknau,\" Kwiet examines perhaps the most important aspect of Zippi\\'s testimony. With her proficiency in German and educational training in graphic design, she was entrusted with the registration of new arrivals and the labeling of uniforms of inmates. Nazi officials used the colored triangle (Winkel) on the uniforms of new arrivals as an effective device in all concentration camps to monitor and control the prisoners by creating a hierarchy and divisions among the inmates. Nazi designated color-coding indicates \"red for political prisoners, green for \\'criminals,\\' purple for Jehovah\\'s Witnesses, black for prostitutes and other social outcasts, black or brown for Sinti and Roma, blue for \\'emigrants\\'\" (p. 17). Although camp life for the rank and file was humiliating, dehumanizing, and even deadly, Zippi was lucky to belong to the camp elite; she never wore an armband and was privileged to receive preferential treatment in terms of better dress, food, and housing. In \"Recapturing the Past: Individuality and Cooperation in Auschwitz\" (Chapter 2), Tec explores the wartime history of Zippi, highlighting her childhood, life for Jews in German-occupied Slovakia, and her ability to navigate a delicate balance in Auschwitz-Birknau between submission to SS orders and her offers to help various resistance groups and/or individuals. Although Zippi denies being a resister, her history and testimony indicates a close connection to individuals who belonged to resistance groups. In \"Displacing Memory\" (Chapter 3), Matthaus analyzes Zippi\\'s first documented account of her wartime life story, based on a 1946 interview in a Displaced Persons (DP) camp in Feldafing, Germany, she granted David Boder, a psychology professor at the Illinois Institute of Technology. Boder\\'s interview was part of a project designed to record the wartime memories of DPs. …', 'year': 2010}, {'paperId': 'cdbb8957517a53a8f2dfab395b36f1930d2c026a', 'title': 'Book review: The liberation of the camps: the end of the Holocaust and its aftermath by Dan Stone', 'abstract': 'In The Liberation of the Camps: The End of the Holocaust and its Aftermath, Dan Stone explores the deconstruction of the Nazi camp network.

Meaning-making theorists, however, have suggested that people who have suffered severe, direct traumas may be the most likely to search for meaning but the least likely to find it. This unfortunate conclusion is based on empirical studies that have narrowly construed meaning making as “making sense” or “finding benefit” and that have limited their investigations to examining cognitive systems of appraisal. Armour found that family survivors of homicide victims employed other meaning-making processes and documented how activity or the intentional engagement in behaviors designed to focus explicitly on the things that matter most after trauma is often a part of the meaning making of those for whom cognitive processes alone prove less than healing. This mixed-methods study applies Armour's own theory of meaning making grounded in action to a historic and mass trauma by examining how 133 Holocaust survivors pursued what mattered at three different time points: during the Holocaust, after they immigrated to the United States, and as older adults. Content analysis of audiotaped interviews found that survival expressed through actions and attitudes was the core theme at all three time points. During the Nazi regime, survivors kept themselves alive physically by refusing to consider the option of death, being lucky, outwitting the Nazis, stealing, and following a strict philosophy of independence or collectivism. They kept hope alive through believing in liberation, attaching to personal fantasies of what the future might hold, and remaining loyal to loved ones and having faith in their reunion. After immigration, survivors focused on survival by striving for education and family; having children; being successful; shutting the door to the past; and cultivating proactive attitudes such as gratitude, acceptance, and the dissolving of hatred. As older adults, survivors' concerns with survival are expressed through maintaining their health, fulfilling their obligations to those who died, and taking principled stands to fight hatred and oppression.\", 'year': 2010}, {'paperId': 'cdd93c16539aa52fde78c48292664ff4c68a2680', 'title': 'Evaluation Findings of a Community-Based Intervention for Older Adults With a History of Trauma', 'abstract': 'Abstract Between 70% and 90% of Americans aged 65 and older have experienced at least one traumatic event such as a sexual or physical assault, disaster, illness, or terrorism. Trauma exposure in older adult populations is linked to physical, mental, and cognitive decline. A new approach to improve outcomes of trauma-affected older adults is Person-Centered, Trauma-Informed (PCTI) Care, which promotes the dignity, strength, and empowerment of trauma-affected individuals by incorporating knowledge about trauma into agency programs, policies, and procedures. The Administration for Community Living/Administration on Aging has awarded The Jewish Federations of North America (JFNA) a grant to develop innovative PCTI interventions for Holocaust survivors. This includes a community-based intervention whereby local leadership councils are developed to identify Holocaust survivor needs, distribute grant funding, train caregivers in PCTI care, and forge partnerships to advance community-led Holocaust survivor care. This program has been implemented in eight major US cities where 168 community leaders dispersed 25 grants serving approximately 500 Holocaust survivors. JFNA conducted an evaluation of the first six of the eight cities to determine the impact of this community-based model on participants and Holocaust survivors and investigate the process by which a community-based model can be replicated. This evaluation used surveys and semi-structured interviews to collect data on variables including understanding of PCTI care, awareness of Holocaust survivor needs, strength of community partnerships, and leadership council sustainability.

Not only have non-art historians become more comfortable in using photographs in their lectures, but photographs as evidence have also proliferated well beyond the confines of photographic histories. Much of this scholarship has built on the foundational work in the late 1990s by scholars such as Marianne Hirsch as well as the contributions that played out in the pages of the journal Fotogeschichte. In addition, scholars have been aided by access to huge online photographic archives (such as that of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum) as well as the exhibition of new or under-utilised sources. From the famed debates on photographs in the Wehrmacht exhibition (Hamburg 1995) to the more recent interest in the suddenly discovered photograph album of Auschwitz-Birkenau from the SS officer Karl Hoecker, photography has become an interdisciplinary source for explorations of the history, memory, and cultural analysis of the Nazi era. The richness of new visual material can be exemplified by the Museum of Contemporary Art in Krakow’s catalogue on the photography of Wilhelm Brasse, recently translated into English as Wilhelm Brasse, Photographer 3444 by William Brand. Brasse was a non-Jewish Polish national who survived in Auschwitz by working for the Identification Service (Erkennungsdienst) of the SS, taking photographs of inmates but also of the SS. The majority of this catalogue is a first-person biography culled from 2010 interviews with the editor, Maria Anna Potocka. While roughly chronological, the narrative follows the pattern of many testimonies in that it jumps around, emphasises traumatic incidents of cruelty (naming the perpetrators when possible), and highlights specific moments in the history of the camp. That said, Brasse’s story is extraordinary in that it is one of the few of a survivor that covers almost the entire history of the camp and, in addition, it foregrounds the surprising way in which photography became a working part of the camp. From the documentation of incoming inmates to the portrait work for the SS that helped him survive, Brasse tells a blunt tale of how the dual function of photography as cultural and documentary tool integrated into a world of cruelty for the SS. At the same time, it also provided possibilities of survival for inmates. Photographic work was highly privileged labour, guaranteeing much better conditions than most forced labour at the camp. In addition, Brasse’s story shows how the photographic studio became a social network connecting many infamous personalities in the camp (such as Josef Mengele). And yet, this same function as a place where various peoples connected also meant that the studio could be used to establish important links with inmates’ groups that gave some a chance to survive. Coupled with examples of Brasse’s official and unofficial work, the catalogue models how this new biographical and visual evidence can help extend important debates about survival and memory in the study of the Holocaust. Frances Guerin, a film studies specialist, has also ventured into this debate with Through Amateur Eyes, a book that analyses complex examples of banal photographs and home movies during the period. Her use and interpretation of these sources is a welcome reminder to the non-visual culture specialists about the importance of close looking and attending to the representational conventions specific to this medium. The book makes a strong contribution to the field that implicitly critiques those scholars who would see amateur photography (or, by extension, any visual representation) as transparent to a historically monolithic position. For Guerin, images – including the most mundane – function on many different levels, from the indexical to the aesthetic to the memorial. She insists on teasing out the varied ways that a photograph can be interpreted and in so doing complicates our understanding of everyday life in National Socialist Germany as well as its relationship to the most brutal politics and ideological agenda of the state. The volume is thus a powerful reminder of how photographs work as evidence and what they contribute to a more nuanced approach to the Nazi period. Through Amateur Eyes tackles this subject in five substantive chapters that work through a range of photographic sources. Throughout, Guerin is particularly interested in the way that perpetrator and bystander images both reveal aspects of a Nazi ideological position but also refuse being reduced to a static ideology due to the ruptures, edges,', 'year': 2014}, {'paperId': 'd138e4953f5a7bfe12942fff3274c1ad84220cfb', 'title': 'Cultural translation in the context of glocalization', 'abstract': 'Recently, studies of trauma have drawn attention to the status of language as a form of representation in the face of overwhelming experiences. Responses to the issue of narrative representation, particularly the capacity of language to represent traumatic events, are polarized, however. Two parallel yet contradictory contentions regarding the efficaciousness of language and narrative as modes of representation have emerged. On the one hand, scholars such as psychologist and social critic Judith Herman argue in favour of the power of language and narrative, particularly the model of storytelling that we commonly refer to, following psychoanalysis, as the \"talking cure.\" Although the process of representing trauma is often demanding, Herman argues that language or the act of telling the trauma story as a \"talking cure\" has the capacity to render the elusive traumatic event, an act of representation that ultimately has therapeutic benefits, offering \"relief of many of the major symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder\" (183). From another perspective, Dori Laub, a psychoanalyst who works with Holocaust survivors, and literary critics, such as Shoshana Felman and Cathy Caruth, consistently draw attention to the limitations of language and storytelling. Trauma is defined by these critics as an overwhelming occurrence that is so complete, literal, and pure it demands a vocabulary and syntax incommensurable with what went before it. As Laub puts it, \"there are never enough words or the right words [...] the story [...] cannot be fully captured in thought, memory, and speech\" (63). Dominick LaCapra, however, has recently noted the dangers of this approach, arguing that it has engendered a \"psychoanalytically based fatalism\" (151) in current theories, where \"mourning itself may always seem fatalistically to come back to an endless melancholy\" (151). This critical perspective, LaCapra posits, \"eliminate [s] possibilities of working through\" the traumatic event, or fails to \"provide much insight into them\" (150). What exists, then, is a critical impasse that addresses not only the subject of language but also, as Laub describes it, storytelling, particularly in the form of talk therapy. Storytelling is situated as both powerful and redundant: it can give representation to an incomprehensible event and engender cure, while it simultaneously threatens to collapse under the strain of a traumatic episode. In effect, storytelling disallows even the prospect of working through trauma to promote psychic healing. The impasse described here is not only apparent in theoretical works on trauma; it is also evident in contemporary fiction that deals with issues of trauma, srorytelling, and representation. It is a preoccupation particularly shared by Canadian author Michael Ondaatje. He has indirectly suggested his interest in these issues in an interview with Eleanor Wachtel, where he reveals that the subject of healing is a central concern in his second novel, The English Patient. \"It is a book about very tentative healing among a group of people. I think it is that most of ail\" (255-56). Ondaatje is not taking on the role of physician or even psychotherapist here; rather, I believe his interest in healing is decidedly literary. Specifically, both The English Patient and its antecedent, In the Skin of a Lion, explore the issue of traumatic recovery in concert with an investigation of storytelling in the form of the \"talking cure.\" Like current theorists of trauma, Ondaatje explores the capacity of storytelling during talk therapy to represent and, by extension, reconcile trauma. Unlike the medical discourses that often influence discussions of trauma and narrative, however, reconciliation for Ondaatje has less to do with clinical efficacy than with broader aesthetic, political, and cultural issues, such as representation, humanism, and identity politics. If Ondaatje is interested in \"healing\" and, by extension, the capacity of storytelling to heal by representing trauma, he is implicitly implicated in the previously discussed debate that characterizes current thinking on traumatic representation. …', 'year': 2009}, {'paperId': 'd14d356f28d8352d250666a5e92d064505c56ce1', 'title': 'Retraumatization of Holocaust survivors during the Gulf War and SCUD missile attacks on Israel.', 'abstract': 'The purpose of this work was to study the reaction to a new threat and a new trauma of people severely traumatized in the past, when the new trauma had associations with the original one caused by the Holocaust.

Nat Paterson (Portland, OR: Vallentine Mitchell, 2017), 344 pp., hardcover $74.95, paperback $29.95. Echoes of a Lost Voice: Encounters with Primo Levi is an invaluable resource for Levi scholars as well as a fascinating read for anyone exploring his reflections on the Holocaust, writing, science, Judaism, and many other topics. A translation by Nat Paterson from the original Italian edition (1992), Echoes compiles interviews with and articles by Levi, organized chronologically and contextualized by Gabriella Poli and Giorgio Calcagno. Each chapter is dedicated to a different work or collection by Levi, describing its genesis while referencing his side projects and relating media attention from the time. Echoes is a sort of literary biography, exploring Levi’s evolution as a writer, his role in adaptations of his works, his ongoing reflections on the Shoah, and other topics. The book thus brings together articles scattered in various outlets over a great deal of time. Echoes avoids synopses of Levi’s works, and there is no attempt to determine the veracity of events he recounted, as can be found in biographies like The Double Bond by Carole Angier (2002) or Primo Levi: A Life by Ian Thomson (2014). Additionally, there is little on his personal life or family. Instead, Echoes’ purpose is assembling decades of interviews and extra-literary work into a single volume for readers who may not know of their existence or have access to them. Poli and Calcagno focus on Levi as an author and public intellectual, and long passages are direct quotes. Chapter 1, “The Centaur,” focuses on If this is a man and Levi’s emergence as a writer. Chapter 2, “A New Incarnation,” examines The Truce, but also Levi’s fears, doubts, and hopes for the play based on his Holocaust memoir (the authors contend that Levi was still resolving survivor versus writer identity issues). Chapter 3, “The Welding,” looks at The Periodic Table and Levi as an “author of memory,” but it also depicts Levi’s visits to schools to talk about Auschwitz. The very short chapter 4, “Poetry, a Strange Infection,” treats Levi’s verse, which he had been writing starting in 1943, showing that he had a strong urge to write before his Holocaust memoir. Chapter 5 “From the Lab to the Writing Desk,” concerns Levi’s short stories and talks presented throughout Italy, also discussing his theories about writing and his reflections on the Italian literary scene and the poetics of the time. In chapter 6, “Holiday Interlude,” we discover the role Levi played in the films and recordings based on his works. Chapter 7, “The Watershed,” portrays Levi’s experience writing The Monkey Wrench, affording the reader insight into his feelings regarding his home city of Turin, the Piedmontese dialect, and the importance of labor. Chapter 8, “If We Keep Silent, Who Will Speak?,” documents Levi’s visit to Auschwitz at a time when Holocaust denial was rearing its head. In chapter 9, “Giving and Having,” the authors delve more deeply into issues of identity, the importance of work, and thoughts on writing with specific reference to his compilation of The Search for Roots. In chapter 10, “A Happy Creature,” the writing of If Not Now, When? takes center stage and we learn of the freedom Levi felt writing his first non-autobiographical novel. Chapter 11, “Jewishness,” examines Levi’s perception of his own Jewishness as well as his attitudes toward Israel. Chapter 12, “Field Invasions,” presents Levi’s acceptance of the fact that writing was now his work, depicting the period around the creation of The Drowned and the Saved. Finally, chapter 13, “The Circle Closes,” discusses some of the final words Levi penned before his suicide, addressing such matters as the notion of a collective voice in remembrance, the idea of forgiveness and repentance, and the need for a Hippocratic Oath for scientists. This organization of chapters chronologically by literary work provides an opportunity to compare Levi’s thoughts through time, since some of the same topics surface repeatedly.

It should not be limited to just one day a year, nor should it be restricted to just one group of people, or certain institutions. Smaller-scale commemoration can be just as insightand impactful as official talks, or the curated work found in large, dedicated museums. Over the past five years I have been lucky enough to experience a very personal and emotive form of commemoration in the form and shape of traditional storytelling. I first met Shonaleigh in July 2013 when I was hosting an international conference on Holocaust commemoration in contemporary culture at the University of Portsmouth, and Shonaleigh joined us as both a speaker and as teller of traditional stories for one of the evenings. Shonaleigh is a Drut’syla, a traditional Jewish Storyteller – and it is believed that she currently is the only remaining practicing Drut’syla. She is also the granddaughter of a Holocaust survivor. The stories she told that evening, but also the way she told them, blew me away. It was a form of ‘commemoration’ I had not encountered before – both polished and raw and engendering a deeply emotive response that I had not quite expected. Since that evening, I have listened to Shonaleigh’s traditional tales many times – and it is always a unique experience, responding to audience responses or demands, seamlessly shifting from one story into another without a script, never following a set plan.

Integration was not seamless. As survivors struggled to carve spaces for themselves within the established Canadian Jewish community, their difficult wartime stories were neither easily received nor understood. When remembering this period, survivors tend to speak about employment, education, dating, integration into both the pre-war Jewish community and the larger society, and, perhaps most importantly, the creation of their own social worlds within existing and new frameworks. Forged in a transitional and tumultuous period in Quebec’s history, these social worlds, as this article demonstrates, are an important example of survivor agency. Although survivors recall the ways in which Canadian Jews helped them adjust to their new setting, by organizing a number of programs and clubs within various spaces—Jeanne Mance House, the Young Men’s and Young Women’s Hebrew Association, and the Jewish Public Library—they also speak about how they forged their own paths upon arriving in this postwar city. For instance, survivors created the New World Club, an informal and grassroots social organization where they could prioritize their own needs and begin to be understood as people, and not just survivors. Establishing the interconnections between these formal and informal social worlds, and specifically, how survivors navigated them, is central to understanding the process through which they were able to move beyond their traumatic pasts and start over. Nightmares and parties are parts of the same story, and here the focus is on the memories of young survivors who prioritized their social worlds.

It examines how the filmic documentation of oral history sources can reflect aspects of testimony, memory, and postmemory, as they are theorized in the field of Holocaust Studies. In my film “Past Forward: Journeys to Transnistria,” I document the challenge of relating an intergenerational and cross-cultural story while preserving historical accuracy. Filmed in Ukraine in 2002, it tells the story of my mother, a child-survivor of the Romanian Holocaust. Through oral testimony, the film captures my mother’s survival story as she tells it to me and later to her granddaughter who documents it for a history school project. It then retraces my mother’s journey between 1941 and 1944 from her hometown of Dorohoi, Romania to Transnistria as it was called then under German-allied Romanian occupation. Survivor’s testimony combined with onsite witness interviews, and an archival military map, were used to trace the story of a little Jewish Romanian girl who survived the journey to Transnistria. Recently available archival sources have further validated her story.

Through an examination of the development of the IWM Sound Archive and the historical processes that led to the inclusion of the Holocaust in the museum’s remit, the article argues that the material is best viewed as a curated collection of source material pertaining to the Holocaust that reflects the historical, cultural and institutional contexts within which it was gathered. The institutional setting of the museum dictated a particular approach to the collection of oral history that best suited its needs, involving both the active creation of its own oral material and the passive collection of relevant audio material produced by third parties. In addition to funding its own project interviewing survivors of the Holocaust, the IWM Sound Archive obtained copies of interviews with survivors conducted for the documentary series The World at War by TV production company Thames Television. The museum also commissioned production company October Films to re-interview a number of survivors for the UK’s first national Holocaust exhibition which opened at the IWM London in 2000. The article demonstrates how the diverse nature of the origins of each interview is reflected in their content and structure, which it illustrates via a comparative analysis of a select number of oral testimonies taken from the archive. In demonstrating the influence of context on content, the article makes an argument in favour of the (re)contextualisation of archived oral testimonies and posits that as a contextually produced corpus of material on the subject, this collection of oral histories can be understood as forming a contemporary response to the Holocaust.', 'year': 2019}, {'paperId': 'd69dc8c96def45f85210b0a6223a67f4023efd77', 'title': 'Echoes of transgenerational trauma in the lived experiences of Jewish Australian grandchildren of Holocaust survivors', 'abstract': 'Abstract Objective Previous experimental research has yielded inconclusive findings regarding the effects of Holocaust trauma to survivors’ descendants, while qualitative studies have suggested diverse long‐term impacts of this traumatic past. While the extant literature has focused mainly on Israeli and North American children of survivors, this study drew on theories of transgenerational trauma transmission to explore the lived experiences of six Jewish Australian grandchildren of Holocaust survivors. Method Data from semi‐structured interviews were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis to investigate how the impacts of historical trauma are experienced across generations in an Australian sample. Results The impact of their grandparents’ Holocaust experiences was found to echo across the participants’ affective experiences, their sense of connection to family histories, their understanding of being different to others, and their political and ethical values. An analysis of these findings suggested that the participants define themselves in a collective manner as part of a group of survivors’ descendants, with their post‐Holocaust positioning existing in a state of tension alongside their Australian identity. Conclusions This study extends the literature on transgenerational trauma by shedding light on how the identities of Australian grandchildren of Holocaust survivors continue to be profoundly informed by their identification with familial narratives of trauma, despite their generational distance from the Holocaust.', 'year': 2018}, {'paperId': 'd6eab6c6fbd0a30b1bc2fd61646aa57b363c0999', 'title': 'Lechem Hara (Bad Bread), Lechem Tov (Good Bread): Survival and Sacrifice During the Holocaust', 'abstract': 'In Judaism, human nature is understood as existing on a spectrum between yetzer hara (evil inclination) and yetzer tov (good inclination).

I argue that Shoah is traversed by the voices of women — both spoken and remembered. Vocal representations of women thus trace a path toward the unrepresentable image that haunts the film in its entirety: death itself. In Shoah, women tread between the image and its absence: the testimonies of the four women survivors in the film, which culminate in an untranslated song in Yiddish; the appearance and disappearance of the interpreters (all women), whose voices weave through the film pointing to the displacement of one language to another and to what is irreparably lost in translation the men who remember women — and their words — inside the gas chambers. Probing this intimacy of image and absence, I have been led to study the film's outtakes ; the most outstanding feature of these interviews is the ever-unstated but always present choices that constitute the film as it stands, but are themselves both unseen and unvoiced; any critical reflection on the film must concern itself with its making — that is, the arbitration between visibility and invisibility, presence and absence, montage and archive.\", 'year': 2011}, {'paperId': 'd79267bb0ce865cee62465956e3b3cc732ba7346', 'title': '‘To Speak for Those Who Cannot’: Masha Rol’nikaite on the Holocaust and Sexual Violence in German-Occupied Soviet Territories', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2020}, {'paperId': 'd7f1e94c4b01f471dd1b2806d305d73c435b116f', 'title': 'Paradise Camp: Documenting the Holocaust', 'abstract': \"Since migrating from Europe to Australia with his family in 1956, over four decades the author developed a distinguished career as a documentary film producer/director and oral historian, before he was ready to tell the stories of his own people through filmed testimonies of Holocaust survivors.

Among Slovak historians it has been a rather neglected tool and the volume under review represents a welcome attempt to establish oral history as a legitimate and helpful instrument of historical inquiry into the Holocaust. It has grown out of a research project run as part of the Oral History Programme of the Milan [ Scar on] ime[ car on] ka Foundation, focusing on the “Fates of Those Who Survived the Holocaust.” This is in several respects a pioneering book. Firstly, it tries to overcome the isolation of various social science disciplines. Bringing together anthropologists, historians and sociologists, it provides a much needed impetus for interdisciplinary cooperation. Its interdisciplinary nature is further enhanced by the fact that the circle of initiators and agents within the project is not limited to the academics involved but includes the technical crew and the survivors themselves on an equal footing. Secondly, the book focuses on the recollections of both Jewish and Roma survivors. The oral history approach implies a twofold process of mediation. On the one hand, memories are always already interpretations of that which is remembered and they tend to evolve over time. The second form of mediation transpires as the survivors seek to convey their recollections to a team of academically trained listeners. A substantial part of the book discusses the preparatory phase of the project in which the authors grappled with the fundamental questions of how best to approach witnesses, how to address the ethical and legal issues involved in research focusing on human subjects, and how to create the most conducive environment for the attainment of their research goals. The greatest challenge lay in the actual interviewing of the survivors. How could the researchers best deal with the strong emotions unleashed by the interviews? How would they deal with individual recollections that conflict with established historical information? The account offered of these discussions seems frank, occasionally reveals genuine insecurity and overall provides an interesting insight into the attempt of a group of academics to grapple with their exposure to the trauma of the Holocaust. The team sought to create as bare a setting for the interviews as possible in an attempt to avoid all possible distraction (here, for once, the sparse funding available to the post-communist social sciences turned out to be a blessing). The interviews were consistently conducted by two people, an older male interviewer of Jewish background and a younger female interviewer of non-Jewish origin. This allowed the interviewees to turn their attention to the interviewer they considered more likely to understand more sensitive religious or gender-related issues.

Sexual violence against men and boys during the Holocaust was likely a regular occurrence, but it has remained undocumented and under-researched. Sexual violence against men, because it does not conform to prevalent gender norms and expectations, has been subjected to cultural and epistemic erasure. As a result, it is construed on the model of female rape, making it difficult to recognize male-victim specific forms of assault. Moreover, normative and legal frameworks developed to address it do not take into account the role that the stigma of homosexuality plays in male sexual violence. This article is based on oral testimonies by male heterosexual-identified Jewish survivors of the Holocaust.

The special circumstances of the Holocaust have resulted in a documentary history which has been told from the perspective of the Nazi perpetrators. Only oral testimony can enable us to understand the actions and reactions of Jews faced with harassment, expropriation, exile, and murder. The practice of oral history was not originally designed for eliciting memories of traumatic events. Holocaust oral history requires the historian to reject the positivist conception of the objective and distanced interviewer, in favor of a position as compassionate listener to painful personal experiences. Interviews can produce less mediated, more spontaneous versions of memory, which require sensitive interpretation. The oral histories of Jewish refugees to Shanghai are examined to demonstrate how careful reading and listening can elucidate the social memories, and thus the social history, of Jews in the Holocaust. The process of interviewing also helps the historian bridge the experiential gap with survivors, enabling a better understanding of their experiences. What do you want me to do?

Less than a year after his trip to Israel, Celan committed suicide. Because his suicide followed so soon after his visit, critics have tended to identify it as a decisive moment in his biography, a moment which represents the culmination of his work and which explains why he took his life. The interpretation of this visit has invariably taken one of two forms, each of which resembles a sentimental narrative. Either the troubled poet, haunted by the events of the past, found the serenity in Israel to lay down his pen or, alternatively, the trip there served only to accentuate his sense of homelessness insofar as the holy land could not replace his lost homeland, Czernowitz. Both interpretations of this trip are based on speculations which reveal more about the agenda of the critic than Celan\\'s poems; specifically, they reveal the teleological direction critics have sought to give Celan\\'s work, so that it can be conceived as a progression toward a close. One fact that remains irrefutable about Celan\\'s trip to Israel is the interview he had on Israeli national radio with Yehuda Amichai. In the interview, Celan not only affirmed his Judaism, but also intimated what Judaism meant for him as a poet: \"I believe I can say that I am of course a Jew...Of course, Jewishness has a thematic aspect, but I don\\'t believe that the thematic aspect suffices to define Judaism. Jewishness is as it were also a pneumatic concern\" (pp. 66-7).Lydia Koelle bases the title of her recent study of Celan on this statement. Submitted as a dissertation in the Department of Catholic Theology at the University of Bonn, the study examines the religious and, in Koelle\\'s view, specifically Jewish dimensions of Celan\\'s verse which, she suggests, cannot be accounted for in a literary reading, but which require a theological approach (p. 56). Her distinction between literary criticism and theology derives in part from the German academic system where disciplines are distinguished from one another not only on the basis of their methodology, but also their subject matter. The question, nonetheless, remains in the case of Koelle\\'s book what a theological reading of Celan\\'s work is and how the subject matter of such a reading differs from that of a literary reading which heeds what is arguably the most theological of all concepts, the word.Koelle argues in her introduction that a theological approach foregrounds the \"`figures\\' and forms of expression\" (p. 24) in texts which can be identified with particular religious discourses, traditions, and cultures. In the case of her study, she underscores the Jewish elements in Celan\\'s work in order to explicate in what ways his poems can be understood as being \"pneumatically\" Jewish. The elements she isolates and analyzes stem from three main sources: the large collection of Judaica in Celan\\'s library, German and Eastern European Jewish culture (including Ashkenazi liturgy and ritual practice), and the geography of Jerusalem as it is reflected in the series of poems, now known as the Jerusalem Cycle, published in the posthumous collection Zeitgehoft.

This awareness that words fall to communicate across generations, cultures, religions, etc. is the legacy of children of Jewish Holocaust survivors who both can\\'t understand and are formed by their parents\\' stories/experiences. By engaging Deb Filler\\'s film rendition of her one-woman stage show, Punch Me in the Stomach, and Abraham Ravett\\'s documentary Everything\\'s for You, I explore the ways in which film allows the second generation to confront, articulate, and ultimately resolve some of those absences and fragments that are their Holocaust narrative. This article is available in Journal of Religion & Film: https://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/jrf/vol3/iss2/3 Four. Three. Two. One. The film begins, but with no color, no sound, and no pictures. \"His name was Chaim\" flashes on the screen, white letters on black backdrop. It disappears, and is repeated in English, in Hebrew; the name, not the person signified, changes with location and relationship to equally as silent, equally as written speaker: \"My mother called him Henyek,\" \"In New York they called him Herbert, .... I called him...\". The film begins. This time with music, with color, and with the close-up of a woman in pale, white make-up, putting on deep red lipstick in the reflection of the camera-lens. She opens with a joke about an old Jewish woman on her death bed, and the make-up once vaguely reminiscent of a clown or a mime, may suddenly resurrect a Jewish-American vaudevillian history of Shylocks and sheenies, of comedy and implicit tragedy. The differences between Abraham Ravett\\'s Everything\\'s for You (1989) and Deb Filler\\'s Punch Me in the Stomach (1995) are apparent from the very beginning: Ravett immediately destabilizes the audience by assaulting them with lack--silence, absence of color, images of text on otherwise blank screen; Filler centers the audience by giving them what they expect--a soundtrack, a character, a script. And yet, I would suggest that the more subtle similarities are the most telling: aesthetically speaking, both authors rely on stark colors to unsettle the audience, to attest to the contradictions that they and their narratives embody; both narratives open with death--Chaim is past tense and the Jewish woman lays dying; and both speak to the self-reflexivity of the performances--Ravett and Filler are simultaneously writer, director, and character, 1 Levi: Performing Selves/Performing as Self Published by DigitalCommons@UNO, 1999 situated both on and off stage at all times. And, each artist almost immediately attributes this fragmented existence, the inspiration for the work, to his or her most formative identity, that of child of Jewish Holocaust survivors. In this paper, I would first like to posit this layered performance as the inheritance of children of Jewish Holocaust survivors, so that I may then explore the ways in which Ravett and Filler use physical performance to confront and, in part, resolve the fragments, gaps and silences of this legacy. I specify Jewish Holocaust survivors because, in many ways, I see Jewishness itself as inextricably linked to both physical performance and linguistic performativity during the Holocaust and, therefore, integral to the identity formation of the second generation. Admittedly, these vastly different notions of \"perform\" are rarely, if ever, discussed in tandem, and I, too, must contextualize them separately before showing how they converge in Holocaust Jewishness and the lives of second generation Jewish survivors. The more traditional understanding of performance, that of the theater in which people play roles often written for them by others, manifests itself in disparate ways during the Holocaust. European Jews such as Ida Fink and Sarah Kofman assumed Aryan identities in order to escape the camps. By consciously performing \"sameness,\" Fink and others necessarily redefined Jewishness as a series of actions and dialects that were to be avoided at all cost and, as such, 2 Journal of Religion & Film, Vol. 3 [1999], Iss. 2, Art. 3 https://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/jrf/vol3/iss2/3 rendered it equally as performable. Once in the camps, Jews were subjected to what survivor Terrence DesPres refers as a systematic \"excremental assault\\'\\' until they were forced to embody the filthy, bestial Jew of Nazi propaganda. In short, they were forced to perform Jewishness as the Nazi\\'s desire to see it. I would suggest that the connection between this type of performance, and the more theoretical discussions of linguistic performativity put forth by J.L. Austin, Judith Butler and others is the central role of audience. In her analysis of hate speech, Butler argues that much racially charged speech performs unique discursive histories of very real, deadly actions and, therefore, incites equally as real physical and emotional responses in its victims. The effectiveness of hate speech, then, depends on the written and unwritten social contracts that exist in specific locations. Everyone involved must recognize the power of the speaker to carry out the actions historically tied to the words used, and the historical lack of power of the victim to escape this hierarchy. In a similar manner, stating \"I am Jewish\" or being called \"Jew\" in Europe during the Holocaust instigated a predictable series of actions-incarceration, torture, loss of family, death. After the war, \"I am Jewish\" performs a history of atrocity that simultaneously distinguishes post-Holocaust from preHolocaust Jewishness and promises a different but equally as notable array of physical and emotional responses. In both theatrical performance and linguistic performativity, then, there is an acute awareness of different audience\\'s needs, 3 Levi: Performing Selves/Performing as Self Published by DigitalCommons@UNO, 1999 desires, fears, and ways of knowing. The success of each depends upon the subject\\'s ability to alter self according to context. Subsequently, whether or not second generation survivors desire to tell one of the many Holocaust stories that has shaped them psychologically and physically, they are taught from birth--through silence and misunderstanding--to play their stories differently for different audiences. As Lori Lefkovitz, second generation survivor, points out in \"Inherited Holocaust Memory and the Ethics of Ventriloquism,\" knowing oneself as \"Child of Holocaust Survivor...freezes us into our position as our extraordinary parent\\'s children,\" and \"second generation\" infers a precarious position that is simultaneously privileged, \"closer to the source,\" and \"emphatically not first.\" Deb Filler shows us that to survivor parents \"emphatically not first\" is fundamental in raising children. Survivor babies are \"placed on solids immediately. [They have] to be strong. [They have] to be happy\" because \"happy\" not only denotes the condition most removed from the event and those forced to endure it, it also promises that the survivors have truly survived by creating a generation that is unshaped by the Holocaust. Once outside the Jewish community, however, the second generation is recognized as \"closer to the event.\" As Filler playing her best friend\\'s mother explains, the Star of David Debby wears symbolizes the ability of the Jewish people to overcome the various \"obstacles\" that they have had to \"put up with.\" For the non-Jewish community, \"Jew\" automatically 4 Journal of Religion & Film, Vol. 3 [1999], Iss. 2, Art. 3 https://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/jrf/vol3/iss2/3 resurrects a tragic, recent history that positions Debby as a unique amalgamation of victim and survivor. By transferring the physical performance inherent in second generation identity from the daily routine to the stage and screen, Filler creates a medium in which she can become those audiences that see her differently. She may explore others\\' relationships to the Holocaust and, subsequently, to herself. But perhaps more importantly, the narrative structure dictated by film, the promise of a beginning, middle, and end, allows Filler and Ravett to unite, if not reconcile their fragmented selves if only for the duration of the film and in the confines of the frame. The first spoken word of Ravett\\'s Everything\\'s for You is \"Pop\" in his own voice. Although Ravett then positions himself off-screen as both interviewer and director, and asks questions such as \"What about your family?\" that seem to remove him personally from the material being discussed, neither Ravett, his viewing audience, nor the subject being interviewed can forget the natural power dynamic that exists between Chaim the father and Abraham the son. The task of the second generation to perform different identities becomes more problematic when disparate worlds collide because audience expectations differ. The viewing audience expects Ravett as director to control visual and aural representation and, as he chooses to be heard but not seen during the interview, he partially succeeds in fulfilling that role. But as son to the father subject who can see Abraham behind 5 Levi: Performing Selves/Performing as Self Published by DigitalCommons@UNO, 1999 the camera, Ravett cannot help but become a part of the narrative the interview is telling. Ravett leads, \"A boy and a girl?\" \"A boy and a girl\" Chaim affirms. \"When was the last time you...\" the interviewer begins before he is interrupted with the desired response. The conflation and predictability of question and answer attests to Abraham\\'s inability/unwillingness to detach himself from his father\\'s narrative. As interviewer he is asking the same questions he has obviously asked many times before as son. Because of this, the traditional view of director/interviewer as the power figure is compromised; Abraham does not have complete control of the film he is ma', 'year': 2016}, {'paperId': 'dd380a6326decbd614ceb22d8d2106d8deb8b318', 'title': 'Talking Versus Hearing About Holocaust Experiences', 'abstract': \"Whereas disclosing traumatic events to others can reduce autonomic nervous system activity and reap positive health benefits for the discloser, the physiological consequences for the listener are less clear.

The teacher replied, \"That can\\'t be correct. They are all dead.\" 2. A grandmother shared how sorry she was that she could not provide the correct answers her granddaughter\\'s teacher wanted concerning rationing during World War II. As a U.S. Navy nurse she explained, \"I never encountered rationing and could only supply a couple of examples I recalled my family and friends saying.\" 3. One Friday, more than 100 fifth-grade students gathered in their school library and listened to a Holocaust survivor relate his World War II experiences; a teacher initiated the visit after learning that a student in another grade was the grandchild of a Polish Holocaust survivor. The World War II generation is indeed dying at a rapid rate, but there are still healthy individuals who are willing to share their stories. Oral history is an active and meaningful practice for learning about changes and continuity between generations. Grandparents, other relatives, or neighbors of many elementary school students could be interviewed, individually or by the class, to learn more about World War II. Interviews should be properly planned so as to ensure the inclusion of multiple perspectives. In this way, teachers can facilitate empathy and encourage openness to new learning opportunities. Without some accurate, prior knowledge about the World War II era, today\\'s elementary student will be unable to gain meaningful understanding of how the war impacted children, families, schools, and communities in different ways. But not all teachers have the time, knowledge, or curriculum priorities that allow such a learning experience. Many turn to the use of trade books. Trade books may tell an interesting story, but too often a trade book fails to set the story into the context of the time. This results in students having only superficial knowledge of the potential meaning of a story. The elementary section in this issue of Social Education seeks to assist busy elementary teachers by providing two detailed lesson plans using two popular instructional strategies: oral history interviews; and reading both primary sources and trade books (on the topic of Japanese internment). Both lessons (the one in this article and the one by Theresa M. McCormick that follows) employ skills in literacy essential to the understanding of history while building essential cognitive skills for historical thinking such as perceiving past events and issues as they may have been experienced by people at the time, developing historical empathy (as opposed to present-mindedness), and recognizing cause and effect in an effort to avoid unsupported generalizations. With these goals in mind, both lessons actively engage students in addressing NCSS Standards {II} Time, Continuity, and Change; (III) People, Places, and Environments; (V) Individuals, Groups, and Institutions; (VII) Production, Distribution, and Consumption; (IX) Global Connections; (X) Civic Ideals and Practice. LESSON Incorporating Multiple Perspectives Rationale: Oral history interviews have the potential of providing important information about historical events, and presenting interviewers with the challenge of evaluating multiple perspectives, interpreting information, and trying to draw accurate historical conclusions. Through the process of conducting oral history interviews students gain a greater understanding of the definition of history as well as important social communication skills. Even children in the lower grades can conduct oral history when a teacher invites appropriate, representative guests to visit the class and answer questions the children have previously agreed to ask.

The Foundation’s project was initially presented to a wide audience, especially by the U.S. press and researchers, as involving the creation of witness holograms. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Misdescribed by media outlets as based around holograms, this USC Shoah Foundation initiative looks, at least for the moment, to create two-dimensional images based on a long recording process and hours of in-depth interviews. Nevertheless, the project is bound to shape the future of Holocaust testimony and oral history itself. The key challenge for its authors remains to explain what the project actually is and to develop the concept of interactive biography, a name proposed by Stephen Smith, but not fleshed out enough in any academic articles in the author’s opinion. Consequently, this paper aims to discuss the USC Shoah Dimensions in Testimony project as a collection of interactive biographies, with particular emphasis on what an interactive biography is, as well as formulate a definition and propose alternative terms. For this purpose, the author proposes an interdisciplinary approach. To define interactive biography, this article will necessarily describe the mechanisms governing the project, the technique for displaying two-dimensional recordings of survivors, and how this aforementioned interactivity operates in the encounter of two-dimensional images of survivors and the recipients of their testimony. Finally, this paper will also look to answer attendant questions, including whether the project works as a post-memory tool for sharing survivor stories, and how are the survivors expressed in a digital tool.', 'year': 2023}, {'paperId': 'e087e1c673af45617d950961af2c59de8d2ae0fd', 'title': 'Facing the Holocaust in Generations of Families of Survivors: The Case of Partial Relevance and Interpersonal Values', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2000}, {'paperId': 'e0aa0c0edb1826d9272f75afd17a4d9beb9a4db8', 'title': 'Luba Elbaum interview', 'abstract': 'Interview with Luba Elbaum, survivor of the Nazi Holocaust of the Jewsiew, conducted by Arthur Kirsch.', 'year': 1982}, {'paperId': 'e0b58c168bcbeb88ad9cc6209e419fcd3888be0f', 'title': 'Imagination, performance and affect: a critical pedagogy of the Holocaust?', 'abstract': 'ABSTRACT Based on video testimony interviews held in the Shoah Foundation Institute’s Visual History archive and the Melbourne Jewish Holocaust Centre’s archive, this paper examines Holocaust survivor testimony as it relates to their return to the sites of atrocity, particularly Auschwitz-Birkenau.

Lerner furnished the seminar with a strong Latin American presence, while Renov\\'s scholarly interest in the question of subjectivity and the documentary brought works with compelling and complex uses of the first person to the fore. As hinted by the programmers in the first few days, the works screened gradually began to incite less emotionally harrowing experiences, easing the seminar into a truly complex engagement with the diverse effects, uses and even pleasures afforded by the wreckage of history. Arguably the most emotionally disturbing film of the seminar was Oh, Uomo (Oh, Man, 2004), the latest feature from found footage by masters Yervant Gianikian and Angela Ricci Lucchi. This final part of their First World War trilogy begins with a fantasmatic journey through the fascist imagination that is initially filled with the disciplined masculine bodies of the Italian military. However, footage of an eye operation substantially more visceral than Luis Bunuel\\'s infamous scalpel shot suddenly opens the film\\'s vision onto the war trauma that fascism was designed to repress: emaciated, starving children and soldiers with the most horrific facial injuries and limb amputations. In light of the censorship and strict regulation of images depicting the human costs of the current war in Iraq (and elsewhere), these fragments of footage from the early twentieth century appeared hauntingly contemporary. Gianikian commented in a discussion that \"Our work is dedicated to the present. The past does not exist for us.\" Nevertheless, a number of participants expressed anxiety about the ethical implications of the unrelenting succession of such clinically cold depictions of corporeal trauma. The debate over history and affect continued after the screening of an altogether different film, Mark Jonathan Harris\\'s Oscar-winning Into the Arms of Strangers: Stories of the Kindertransport (2000). Well researched and highly polished, the film organizes itself around carefully staged studio interviews with survivors of the Kindertransport (which saved thousands of Jewish children from the Holocaust). Several seminar participants remarked on the emotionally overwhelming orchestration of the material (both visually and aurally), which isolated the testimonial interviews from their historical context, potentially risking their degeneration into fetishized moments of emotional catharsis. This question of retaining the emotional power of bearing witness without diminishing the historicity of the testimonial act itself--i.e. its status as an historical event in its own right--returned during the discussion of a number of animated films that combined the morphing plasticity of worlds created by animation with the documentary authenticity of testimonial voiceover. As Renov pointed out in a discussion on the fifth day, the voices on the soundtrack of such works retain an indexical claim on the real and the historical, even though their animated images cannot. Of particular interest was Dennis Tupicoff\\'s His Mother\\'s Voice (1996), based on a radio interview with an Australian mother bearing witness to how she discovered the sudden death of her 16-year-old son. …', 'year': 2005}, {'paperId': 'e226a6695b9fc9284e4713ab469fc1e7aa1d4292', 'title': 'Oral History Interviews with Brigitte Friedmann Altman, December, 1989', 'abstract': 'Interview with Brigitte Friedmann Altman, a holocaust survivor from Memel (Klaipeda), Lithuania.

Hebb Award. I have two reasons for beingespecially pleased about the award. One is that it recalls my link with,and debt to, Donald Hebb, who among his many important contributions wasthe pioneer of research on how human beings are affected by stimulusrestriction, a question that has occupied much of my scientific attentionover the past three decades.The second is that, as the citation for my award indicated, I am ageneralist in an era of ever-increasing scientific specialization. Myresearch methods cover laboratory experiments, field observations,psychophysiological measures, paper and pencil tests, interviews, andarchival analyses; the areas in which I do research include environmental,social, personality, political, cognitive, and health psychology. I havesometimes wondered whether my energies would have been better concentratedin one area rather than being focussed, sequentially or simultaneously, onwhatever question seemed most intriguing at a given time. In retrospect,I\\'m happy that I followed my interests wherever they led me; but it wasgratifying to discover that my fellow psychologists also consider this tohave been a fruitful strategy.Actually, while my enthusiasms have been varied, they were notcompletely random. I discovered one connecting thread only a few yearsago, when I was being interviewed for an oral history project involvingchild survivors of the Holocaust. The interviewer asked me what the commontheme was in my apparently unconnected areas of research. I told him thatI recognized none; but thinking about it afterwards, I realized that myresearch has had one central topic: how human beings react to and copewith events that range from the unpleasant to the catastrophic --experiences that I subsume under the term, \"challenging\".In each of my research areas, most of my colleagues were concentratingon the aversive aspects and adverse consequences of challengingsituations.

Given this importance, the imminent end of the “era of the witness” has sparked fears that the history of the Holocaust could soon be forgotten. The past decades have therefore seen unprecedented efforts to record the testimonies of Holocaust survivors in order to safeguard the immediacy of their accounts. In this essay, I trace how different temporal entanglements have affected the narrated memory of Holocaust survivors and thus also shaped the knowledge of those born later. Focusing on four interviews conducted with a Jewish Holocaust survivor in 1946, 1995, 1998, and 2004 respectively, I explore how biological time, historical time, recording time, and the temporality of narrative have shaped the narrated memories. As I argue, the different temporal entanglements have allowed for starkly different reconfigurations and reconstructions of the past. This renders the study of the epistemic constitutive nature of entangled temporalities important not only for Holocaust studies, but also for the history of knowledge, a field which has recently turned to processes of forgetting and ignorance.\\n', 'year': 2023}, {'paperId': 'e569f6dc90f7a49701d772f7bb95adc0a2854e1a', 'title': 'OTTOMAN TURKISH GENOCIDE OF ARMENIANS: THE LEGACY OF TRAUMA', 'abstract': 'Although there is a plethora of literature on the generational legacy of trauma in the offspring of Holocaust survivors, there are limited data on the impact of trauma on other populations. Despite being the first genocide of the twentieth century, the Ottoman Turkish Genocide of Armenians and its impact on the lives of the Armenian population has not been extensively studied. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the impact of the Ottoman Turkish Genocide of Armenians on second and third generation survivors. Eleven subjects participated in this qualitative study that was comprised of a semi-structured interview and the Relationship Scales Questionnaire (RSQ), used to better understand relationship dynamics among participants. Overall, the participants had difficulties coping with anger and either described having a temper, avoiding anger, projecting anger, or internalizing anger. The majority of participants had negative pervasive attitudes about the world, categorized as either anxious or a distrustful, fatalistic, or pessimistic perspective. Over half of the participants in this study demonstrated a capacity for resilience. The majority of participants seemed to have an attachment style characterized by being trustworthy and dependable but had difficulty trusting and depending on others. The findings of this study were consistent in both children and grandchildren of survivors and no differences were found between generations. Overall the findings of this study are congruent with the current literature. The findings may help clinicians better understand the psychological consequences of intergenerational trauma transmission among Armenians, thus enabling clinicians to develop more effective approaches to help this specific population.

One of these issues is the experiences of groups who challenge our conceptual frameworks and present opportunities for developing different analytical methods. The testimonies of the Jewish Sonderkommando, or forced crematorium workers, of AuschwitzBirkenau present such an opportunity by defying the categories used to describe victims and perpetrators, and by forcing us to reconsider how humans survive when conditions are extreme and violent. This paper argues that the testimonies of the Sonderkommando demonstrate that the conditions of their incarceration necessitated the construction of unique, situational system of personal morality and humanity and that their postHolocaust lives are marred by extreme difficulty in attempts to construct usable narratives about their experiences. Using published testimony and interviews as a source base, the paper endeavors to open up a space in which the coping strategies of the Sonderkommando can be analyzed. To do so, it proposes two particular frames of analysis: the equivocal psyche (a mechanism that, in the absence of cultural, moral, and emotional guidance, constructs an ethical continuum, allowing for a range of mental responses to trauma), and usable narratives (the construction of a personal story of Holocaust trauma that can adequately convey the gravity of the situation and explain one’s actions in that period in a way that does not offend the beliefs of the survivor and their post-Holocaust context).

However, producing evidence based insights into victims' behavior is challenging. Perpetrators frequently destroyed camp documentations; victims' perspective remains dispersed in thousands of oral history interviews with survivors. Listening to, watching, or reading these thousands of interviews is not viable, and there is no established computational approach to gather systematic evidence from a large number of interviews. In this study, by applying methods and concepts of molecular physics, we developed a conceptual framework and computational approach to study thousands of human stories and we investigated 6628 interviews by survivors of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. We applied the concept of state space and the Markov State Model to model the ensemble of 6628 testimonies. The Markov State Model along with the Transition Path Theory allowed us to compare the way women and men remember their time in the camp. We found that acts of solidarity and social bonds are the most important topics in their testimonies. However, we found that women are much more likely to address these topics. We provide systematic evidence that not only were women more likely to recall solidarity and social relations in their belated testimonies but they were also more likely to perform acts of solidarity and form social bonds in Auschwitz-Birkenau. Oral history interviews with Holocaust survivors constitute an important digital cultural heritage that documents one of the darkest moments in human history; generally, oral history collections are ubiquitous sources of modern history and significant assets of libraries and archives.

Oxford: Oxford University Press: 2008. 178 pp. $24.95. If scholars, historians, and survivors could live another hundred years, their stories about their World War II experience would still only be partially told. As we find more stories about what occurred during World War II, we realize that there is so much more yet to be uncovered about those dark years. There are hundreds of thousands of pages that have been written about the Holocaust already. Bad Arolsen, located in Northern Germany, is reported to have fifty million pages of documents dealing with the horrors of Nazi occupation in every corner of the occupied lands. Only recently have these documents become available to scholars and museums. The author, Emeritus Sociology Professor Suzanne Vromen, a French-speaking Belgian, has been able to use her knowledge of both the French language and Belgium in her research to produce a major contribution to the study of the rescue of children by nuns in Belgium during the Holocaust. Fifty of these heroic nuns were honored by Yad Vashem as the righteous among the nations. While there are many studies on the Holocaust and why and when it occurred, there is still an inadequate amount of research about heroism and goodness during World War II. We know of many individuals who have risked their lives to save Jewish victims, but thete are few studies of institutions such as convents, hospitals, and schools that devoted much of their effort to save Jewish victims, especially children. Vromen has interviewed sixteen women and twelve men who were hidden as children, eight nuns, and one priest, as well as other individuals who escorted children to the convents. The rescue was undertaken to a large extent by the Committee of the Defense of Jews, which was organized by Ghert Jospa, a Jewish engineer, as well as six other Jews and one non-Jew. This rescue effort was increased in 1942, when the Nazis introduced a policy of sending Belgians into forced labor in Germany, a development that impelled many Belgians to go into hiding and to intensify their resistance against the Nazis. A number of these people hid in convents and monasteries. Belgium had approximately 56,000-60,000 Jews at one point in 1942; when the roundup took place half the Jews went to their death and the other half went into hiding. Despite the existence of an antisemitic Flemish Nazi organization called the Flemish National Front, established in 1933, the Belgian people were sympathetic and cooperated in hiding and rescuing Jewish people. The book focuses largely on the experiences of the Jewish children hidden in these convents as well as on heroic nuns. These children had to cope with changing identities and names; many children had to be wise and careful to be sure they would not betray their new identity. …', 'year': 2010}, {'paperId': 'e80922a1df2604e4b945a543eef2312f5457eb66', 'title': 'Emerging Technologies and the Advent of the Holocaust “Hologram”', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2021}, {'paperId': 'e822ddb96fa93687c831e99b6cbafeaa198175b7', 'title': 'The Holocaust and Education', 'abstract': 'Michael Berenbaum\\'s understanding of and expertise on \"the paradigmatic event of evil of our time\" is beyond question, Mr. Goldberg points out.

In January 1997 Michael Berenbaum became the president and chief executive officer of Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation, the organization established and chaired by filmmaker Steven Spielberg after he completed Schindler\\'s List in 1993. Spielberg has said more than once that this organization is the central and most important work of his career. Since 1994 the foundation has been recording eyewitness testimony on the Holocaust (Shoah in Hebrew) and set as its goal the high-quality recording of at least 50,000 eyewitnesses. The vast majority of the eyewitnesses are survivors, but liberators, trial prosecutors, and other relevant witnesses are also included. This is a race with time because the war in Europe ended more than half a century ago. Michael Berenbaum is exceptionally qualified to take on the responsibility of heading this large and complex undertaking, now nearing the conclusion of its recording phase and entering its distribution and educational phase. Berenbaum served as deputy director of President Carter\\'s Commission on the Holocaust, whose 1979 report led to the creation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. For more than 15 years Berenbaum worked to bring into being the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C., and to bring intellectual and emotional focus to its displays and material. For his work as project director and then as director of the museum\\'s research institute, Berenbaum was lauded by Museum Chairman Miles Lerman as one of a handful of people most responsible for the creation of the Holocaust Museum: \"Many of the achievements of this institution are here as the result of Michael\\'s dedication, determination, and unyielding optimism.\" Museum Director Walter Reich praised Berenbaum for participating \"very centrally in the conceptualization of the museum\\'s permanent exhibition\" and for assembling artifacts and supervising research activities to support the museum\\'s vision.

His mandate now is to determine with his staff the best ways of sharing with the education community what will soon reach more than 100,000 hours of testimony. The task is very much analogous to what he faced in conceptualizing and organizing the Holocaust Museum. No individual could possibly view even a sizable fraction of this recorded information. Just what should be done with this material? What is to become of it? How can material gathered from 45 countries be transformed into a useful format for future generations of students and museum goers? The centerpiece of the project, according to Berenbaum, is without doubt the testimony itself. All the interviewers are volunteers who undergo 30 hours of rigorous training over several days. Many of the interviewers are psychologists, historians, survivors themselves, or teachers who can devote only a few days each month to the foundation\\'s work. Even so, only those people considered highly qualified to interview Holocaust survivors are selected to work with professional videographers to record testimony in the subjects\\' homes. The average tape runs just over two hours and includes information on events before and after the war, as well as the recollections of wartime experiences. Of course, at least half of the testimony focuses on experiences during the Holocaust.

Holocaust related communication behaviours and their consequences in terms of attitudes and knowledge were studied in two groups of families who survived the Holocaust; fifteen families whose parents were imprisoned in a concentration camp, and fifteen families whose parents were involved in active resistance during World War II. Both parents and first-born child were interviewed by means of a structured interview. The results indicated that there was more sharing of the traumatic experiences in ~the families of ex-partisans: (a) communication on Holocaust related issues was more legitimate in these families, (b) children of ex-partisans had more knowledge about the Holocaust and about their parent’s past and (c) they expressed more positive attitudes toward the survivors. The implications of these findings for the understanding of the psychological consequences of massive psychic traumas are discussed. In the long history of man to man brutality one phenomenon stands out in its atrocity and incredibility the extermination of the. Jewish population in Europe during World War II. Yet the psychological consequences of this phenomenon have not been systematically investigated. Most of the existing reports have drawn on clinical case studies and autobiographies (e.g. Eitinger 1963, 1973, Krystal 1968, 1971, Epstein 1979). The long term effects of this massive psychic traumatization on both the survivors and their descendants remain unknown. The scarcity of systematic, non-clinical studies on the effects of the Holocaust may be seen as one of the manifestations of the conspiracy of silence that has surrounded this subject. The first to break this conspiracy were the clinicians in their role as helping professionals. In the case of the scientists, the positive connotations inherent in helping are absent. Their apersonal, objective approach to an experience such as the Holocaust may be perceived as sacrilegious, and imply intrusion, probing and hurting without the absolution of helping. In spite of the emotional as well as methodological difficulties involved in systematic study of the effects of the Holocaust, such investigation in imperative particularly in light of the impressions recently reported by clinicians (e.g. Davidson 1977, Sigal et al 1973) that the ill effects of this massive psychic traumatization transgress generations as witnessed by the number of children of survivors who seek psychiatric help.

For the survivor, talking about this experience (sometimes for the first time since the war) is often one of great emotion and trauma. These women relive their experiences of sexual assault while giving their memories voice, motivated by the desire to put their stories ‘on the record’. In this paper, I focus on four interviews with women survivors and explore ‘what happens next’ when traumatic memories are shared. I consider how emotions from the event are present in the interview, the inevitable intertwining of memories of sexual violence and those of other traumatic Holocaust events, as well as the way the interview space, and interviewer/interviewee interactions within the interview, affect how emotion is expressed and what emotions are experienced. I also consider ethical implications for how oral historians can use these kinds of difficult interviews, particularly when accessing an existing archive of interviews. Introduction Talking about sexual violence and the Holocaust brings up complicated emotions for many women in the Shoah Foundation’s Visual History Archive. The process of giving Holocaust testimony is arguably an emotive process in itself. But talking about sexual violence in the context of the genocide often leads to complex, layered memories of grief, guilt, shame, trauma, anger, pain and anguish.1 For many survivors, their experiences of sexual violence are intricately intertwined with their Holocaust experiences, and remembering separation from family members, deportations, the people who saved them and even liberation can also mean recalling their memories of abuse and assault. For Holocaust historians interested in sexual violence, oral history is usually the preferred, and often only, source of information. Some scholars have made use of Nazi documentation, but these records are always perpetrator-centred. These documents have proved fruitful in explaining how Nazi institutions dealt with sexual violence against Jewish women, particularly the Wehrmacht (the German army).2 However, they tell us very little about the experience of the survivor or about the prevalence of sexual violence, given that most assaults were not reported to Nazi authorities and many that were reported were not prosecuted. Survivor writings, such as memoirs, poetry and other forms of literature, have been fruitful for discussions of sexual violence.3 In these varied works, survivors discuss fears of sexual violence, moments of vulnerability at camp intake and witnessing sexual abuse against friends and family. While valuable, research utilising written literature and memoirs taps into a small subset of the survivor community with the inclination and ability to communicate their experiences in writing. In light of these evidentiary limitations, the majority of scholars interested in exploring the experiences of Jewish women and sexual violence turn to survivor testimony. Oral testimony allows scholars to gain the insights of multiple survivors, particularly those whose stories may not have been recorded in other forms, offering a breadth of experiences to draw on. This article is drawn from a larger study investigating survivor testimonies discussing sexual violence collected by the USC Shoah Foundation Institute between 1994 and 1999. Holocaust testimony projects are often large scale, but the Shoah Foundation’s venture is the largest collection of audio-visual interviews in the world to date. The Foundation’s Visual History Archive (VHA), its digitised database and testimony repository, houses nearly 52,000 interviews with Holocaust survivors. The testimonies were collected in the mid1990s across 56 countries and in 32 different languages, creating an archive of rich and varied survivor stories. The project was famously begun by Steven Spielberg following the critical and commercial success of his Holocaust film Schindler’s List (1993), leading to his establishment of the Foundation (initially known as the Survivors of the Shoah Foundation) in order to record the stories of as many Holocaust survivors as possible. The Foundation’s ambitious goal of 50,000 interviews by the year 2000 was reached and surpassed, with the resulting testimonies preserved in digital format and made available via institutional subscription around the world.4 Baldwin, ‘And What Happened Next?’ 33 The Shoah Foundation is not without its critics, and its approach to testimony collection and interview procedure has certainly influenced the way difficult stories are told within the VHA.5 The interview process was heavily regulated by the Foundation: interviewer guidelines gave pages of instructions to the volunteer interviewers to ensure consistency between testimonies.6 The interviews were to follow a particular narrative arc: pre-war life in Europe, wartime persecution and postwar regeneration.7 This prescribed format led to a structured interview, and necessitated an ‘interventionist interviewer’ who directed the flow of the discussion.8 While some interviewers are less intrusive than others, the general prescriptiveness of the interview process has largely resulted in fairly guided and interviewer-heavy testimonies. The discussion of sensitive, emotional topics, such as sexual violence, are directly impacted by this, as this article shows. In this article, I consider the testimonies of four women survivors who conducted interviews with the Shoah Foundation between 1995 and 1997 in the United States.9 The testimonies are drawn from a much larger study on sexual violence against Jewish women during the Holocaust. For this project, I watched all 989 English-language interviews conducted by and stored in the digital archive of the Shoah Foundation that were indexed with sexual violence keywords.10 My work is an archival study of the narratives of sexual violence in the VHA, and considers not only what we can learn about sexual violence through these testimonies, but also how these stories are shaped by the institutional context of the interviews, the way survivors have interpreted and reinterpreted their experiences of sexual violence and their decisions to talk about these memories to the Shoah Foundation. Talking about sexual violence during the Holocaust is never easy. For some of the women in my sample, the interview with the Shoah Foundation is the first time they have spoken about these experiences after four decades of silence. Others use the interview as a chance to tell their families (who will receive a copy of the videotaped session) the truth of what happened to them during the war years. These discussions are typically painful, distressing, grief-provoking and difficult for the women. These are not uncommon emotions in Holocaust testimonies, and previous scholars have noted the intricate and complicated layers of trauma survivors carry in their interviews.11 However, the untold nature of many of these stories, and the absence of those like them in Holocaust historiography, which had only just begun to probe gendered experiences in the 1990s, made stories of sexual violence particularly difficult for women to disclose. The interviews are thus loaded with different layers of emotion: that of the initial assault, the cumulative distress of living with the experience for decades before the interview, and the emotion of retelling the story in the interview setting, all wrapped in the larger, traumatic narrative of their Holocaust experience. In this article, I discuss how women’s testimonies about sexual violence are infused with emotion. The testimonies demonstrate the embodiment of past emotion in the survivors’ present, as they recall traumatic memories of sexual violence. They show how emotions can be created within the interview space, either through the act of recollection or due to the interaction with the interviewer. I argue that memories and narratives of sexual violence during the Holocaust can express tangled emotions that make remembering and talking about these events particularly difficult in the present. ‘You are beyond your own help’: Past emotions are also present emotions Recalling trauma means talking about emotions experienced in the past, but it can also mean reexperiencing that pain. In his pivotal work on Holocaust testimony, Lawrence Langer argues that survivors are not ‘reviving’ their memories of traumatic experiences in their interviews: ‘There is no need to revive what has never died’.12 Holocaust survivors live with their complicated memories constantly, and the interview space becomes a place where not only memory is shared but also emotion. A key example of this is Esther G.’s testimony.13 In 1944, Esther was sent to the Skarżysko-Kamienna labour camp in Poland when she was seventeen years old. This camp has become infamous for the rampant sexual violence perpetrated against Jewish female prisoners by not only the guards, but also the German Jewish men, women and children from Hungary are separated for selection on the ramp at Auschwitz II-Birkenau, 1944.

This paper focuses on the Museum’s single largest music collection, that of the Polish camp survivor Aleksander Kulisiewicz (1918—1982). A native of Kraków, Poland, who spent over five years as a political prisoner in Sachsenhausen, Kulisiewicz in later life grew obsessed with documenting the repertoire that his fellow Poles and an international cadre of musicians, authors, and artistes created and performed while captives of the Germans. The collection he amassed during his final decades consists of hundreds of songs, choral works and instrumental pieces gathered from survivor memoirs, manuscripts, and multiple recorded interviews with former inmates. Approximately 70,000 pages of documentation encompass music-related artworks, biographical details of camp poets and composers, and copious additional corroborating material. Apart from providing an overview of the collection, the paper will discuss Kulisiewicz’s cultural and intellectual background in interwar Poland, and postwar career as a performer, activist and author. Music illustrations will be drawn from Kulisiewicz’s archive of sound recordings, including selections from his own series of autobiographical songs written in Sachsenhausen.

It was also a time when the children of survivors began to participate in increasing numbers in the process of bearing witness. For this second generation it was a question not only of helping to elicit their parents’ stories—of persuading them to write, speak, or agree to be interviewed—but also of coming to terms with their own implication in their parents’ experiences. Indeed, many of these children had come to the discovery that the stories of the first generation had already been passed on to them, that they themselves had become the unwitting bearers of a traumatic legacy.

Regardless of his exceptional early effort to record survivors’ stories, Boder was not, as Matthäus convincingly demonstrates, a skilled enough translator, nor even a skilled enough listener, fully to capture a story like Tichauer’s. In addition to his errors in translation, Boder was expecting to hear the voice of trauma in Auschwitz survivors, and he thus failed to grasp that Tichauer’s reliance on the constructions of high German, alongside the vocabulary of Lager-Deutsch, was an important index of the devotion to order and careful observation that had allowed her to survive.

Aim: The aim was to describe nursing assistants’ experiences of caring for older people with dementia who have experienced Holocaust trauma. Research design: A qualitative descriptive and inductive approach was used, including qualitative interviews and content analysis. Participants and research context: Nine nursing assistants from a Jewish nursing home were interviewed. Ethical considerations: The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board, Stockholm. Findings: The theme ‘Adapting and following the survivors’ expression of their situation’ was built on two categories: Knowing the life story enables adjustments in the care and Need for flexibility in managing emotional expressions. Discussion and conclusion: The world still witnesses genocidal violence and such traumatic experiences will therefore be reflected in different ways when caring for survivors with dementia in the future. Person-centred care and an awareness of the meaning of being a survivor of severe trauma make it possible to avoid negative triggers, and confirm emotions and comfort people during negative flashbacks in caring situations and environments.

COMPLEXITY OF LONG-TERM PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF POLITICAL REPRESSIONS IN LITHUANIA Evaldas Kazlauskas, Danutė Gailienė Summary OBJECTIVE:\\xa0This study examined long-term consequences of political repressions during the Soviet regime in Lithuania. Between 1940 and 1958 more than 300,000 Lithuanians were arrested and deported to Siberia (Anusauskas, 1996). Conditions of imprisonment in Gulag camps were extremely hard and mortality rate from exhaustion and disease was high. Victims who managed to return back to Lithuania suffered from persistent persecutions. Traumatic experiences of former political prisoners were neglected for decades; they had to keep in secret the fact of the imprisonment. Less than 5,000 survivors of political imprisonment still live in Lithuania. Since the introduction of posttraumatic stress disorder in DSM-III (1980) trauma effects have been studied mostly in terms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). But clinicians and trauma researchers acknowledge controversies in modern understanding of PTSD (Yahuda, MacFarlane, 1995). Severe impairments in personality of victims have been reported by clinicians working with survivors of holocaust, sexual abuse, and victims of torture, but these changes in personality are not accepted in current understanding of PTSD. The concept of PTSD receives more and more critics due to limitations in describing psychological effects after long term traumatic experiences that may lasts for years. Complex posttraumatic stress disorder has been introduced (Herman, 1992) in result of these discussions to describe variety of effects of long term trauma, and acceptance of this concept is growing in the field. There are only few studies on psychological effects of political repressions in former Soviet Union territory. This is the first study of psychological effects of political imprisonment in Lithuania. The goal of present study was to examine traumatic experiences and psychological effects among non-clinical sample of former Lithuanian political prisoners. METHOD:\\xa0The group of former political prisoners (N=50), with a history of deportation to Gulag camps, was compared with an age and sex matched control group (N=50). Former political prisoners were imprisoned for 6.9 years on average. 43.1 years have passed since their return to Lithuania at a time of research. Semi-structured interviews were used to measure experiences during and after imprisonment. Posttraumatic effects were measured using Lithuanian versions of self-rating scales: Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (Mollica et al., 1992), Impact of Event Scale - Revised (Weiss, Marmar, 1996), Trauma Symptom Checklist (Briere, Runtz, 1989). CONCLUSIONS:\\xa0Results suggest that traumatic experiences dealing with political imprisonment and exile have long-term complex posttraumatic effects on Lithuanian former political prisoners. Concept of complex posttraumatic disorder is partly supported by results of this study. Limitations of the study due to retrospective nature of the study, elderly age of participants and control group selection are discussed.

Sonya's education was abruptly terminated after her graduation from high school, when the Nazis invaded Poland in 1939. Forced into the Lodz ghetto, she was fortunate to be able to study with a woman trained in the Montessori method of childhood education. She and others set up schools for ghetto children, taught them, fed them, and provided for their safety as long as possible. After the children were deported to concentration camps by the Germans, Sonya acquired some nursing skills while tending the diseased and starving population of the abysmally crowded ghetto.

Even though the new opportunities that the Soviet state offered energized many young Jews, it is difficult to judge whether it was a widespread trend. It seems that many members of the Jewish communities, even in Minsk, continued to practice Jewish customs and religious rituals secretly. Moreover, a part of the Jewish cultural elite who were enthusiastic about the Soviet project fostered the idea of a Jewish cultural autonomy. In the 1920s, Yiddish was granted status as a state language and half of the Jewish children went to Yiddish schools (Leonid Smilovicki, “Shkola na Yiddishe v pervyje desjatiletija Sovetskoj vlasti. Evrejskoje obrazovanije v Belorussii. 19211941,” Novaja Evrejskaja Shkola 11[2002]: 171-212). Nevertheless, all of these projects were already terminated by the late 1930s, when almost all representatives of Yiddish literature had been exterminated. Being one of first attempts to write an oral history of the Holocaust in the Soviet Union and simultaneously a broader study of Soviet Jewry, Pioneers and Partisans has great potential to become required reading on the Jewish history of the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, the contributions go far beyond these fields. Making the categories of age and gender central to her analysis, Walke’s work also has its place in youth and gender studies. The book can be recommended for oral historians and anthropologists who wish to strengthen their methodology, since it gives a fascinating example of how interviews may be used. Pioneers and Partisans will also be of interest to a broader audience, as it is a highly professional account with a significant emotional component.', 'year': 2016}, {'paperId': 'f12451240f7fc1a7bb7159c7602e50512a647452', 'title': 'Walking with the Ghost: Contested Silences, Memory-Making, and Cambodian/American Histories of Violence', 'abstract': \"Author(s): Chhun, Lina | Advisor(s): Erai, Michelle F.; Finch, Aisha | Abstract: Commemoration is highly fraught; memory and history-making are dialectical processes, constituted by the contingent relationship between what is remembered and forgotten, and what Lisa Yoneyama terms the “forgetting of forgetfulness.” Memory-making is always punctuated by acts of forgetting, the proliferation of silences that produce historical amnesias as they also produce, paradoxically perhaps, affective remnants—what Ng�, Nguyen, and Lam (2012) refer to as “the particular resonances of…wars, refugee archives of feeling, and the recursive traces of both” (673). Challenging static renderings of history, “Walking with the Ghost: Contested Silences, Memory-Making, and Cambodian/American Histories of Violence” queries the complex relationships between registers of memory regarding the Cambodian Holocaust of 1975-79 and remembrances of the preceding U.S. bombing campaigns of 1964-1973. This study challenges historical models of “tragedy” and individualized models of trauma—as damage-centered, deviance-driven, and/or invested in abjection, vulnerability, and injury—which disavow the complex humanity of Cambodian survivors and the continually intersubjective ways in which knowledge about violence and Cambodia is produced and reproduced. I begin with an analysis of passages from my father's interview regarding the U.S. bombing of Neak Loeung, highlighting the ways experiential registers contain the potential to reproduce as well as trouble dominant Cold War logics. From here, I analyze two cases—the Documentation Center of Cambodia’s framing of its archival mission and artist-documentarian Vandy Rattana’s body of work—addressing the ways archives function to produce different claims to “historical truth” in the afterlife of violence. Following Rattana’s 2009 exhibit “Bomb Ponds”—which photographically depicts the affective pull of landscapes in conjunction with the need to listen to experiential narratives—I then center the “landscape ethnography” as one site of memory-making concerning the U.S. bombing campaigns. Expanding the notion of “living archive,” I employ a capacious understanding of the everyday, assessing how landscapes and stories-in-motion make visible the violence of Cold War histories. Centering an analysis of the multiple meanings of crossing in two oral histories, I end with an exploration of the relational affects and effects of violence and trauma as they travel across time and space. Thinking through queer temporalities, (enforced) transit, and the phenomenon of return, I grapple with notions of justice and reparation in the afterlife of historical violence, thinking reparation not as “repair”— “to fix”—but as “amends,” “to mend,” and therefore, to do the work of care.\", 'year': 2019}, {'paperId': 'f1dd66744fe625a3e2c49b5e7914fa1854e141fa', 'title': 'The Challenges of Oral History in the 21st Century: Diversity, Inequality and Identity Construction Using Online Video Oral Histories in University Courses across the Curriculum', 'abstract': 'El uso de historias orales en videos en línea en los cursos universitarios de todas las disciplinas Gracias a Internet, en la actualidad los educadores tienen un acceso sin precedentes a las historias orales.

We will examine assignment design and pedagogy, student engagement, final products, ways that the educational mission of the collections is being realized, and additional benefits of students building the literacies they need for the 21st Century, including information, media, and digital. As we are reminded every day, digital technologies have revolutionized just about every aspect of our lives, both at home and at the university. As Schrum et al explain in their chapter, Oral History in the Digital Age, “The Internet has greatly expanded the capacity of oral historians to record and disseminate ordinary voices from around the world on an almost limitless array of topics. Oral history, a powerful tool for researching, teaching, and learning about the past is not new, but widespread access to it is” (512). In this field, digital technologies have become integral to the “recording of oral history, as well as the dual imperatives of access and preservation” (Boyd 285). While it is already possible to record interviews more quickly and cheaply, to preserve them in smaller packages and with better sound, and to access collections more easily, the “real revolution,” according to Boyd, will be a “change in consciousness about how oral history, as a history resource, can be engaged and discovered more easily, more widely and effectively distributed, and ultimately, more responsibly preserved” (286). This is what we are going to discuss: the way digital technologies can help professors use oral histories as an engaging teaching tool in various disciplines, which is to say, to actually realize their potential -to use oral histories in educational contexts to fulfill the legacy for which they were intended. We hypothesize that using video oral histories can lead to a high level of understanding and an integration of various kinds of learning. The learning is inherently active and, for most students, powerfully transformative. In Lynn E. Swaner’s words, working with oral histories, students “begin to question, test, and reformulate” their old ways of making meaning and “their views of themselves and the world in which they live” (18). Let’s take a moment to think briefly about all the different ways the new technologies and the Internet have changed oral history. In his chapter, “Achieving the Promise of Oral History in a Digital Age,” published in the 2011 Oxford Handbook of Oral History, Doug Boyd documents the many and varied ways that the digital revolution has already impacted recording, accessing and preserving of oral history. From cumbersome early 20th century audio recording technologies, exotic and available to only a few, we have moved to the YouTube generation where almost everyone can record and distribute video worldwide. As amazing, and speedy, as this journey with technology has been, this is but the beginning of the real revolution of oral history that current technology makes possible. For one thing, technology is changing perceptions and definitions of oral history. Oral history has always meant different things to different people in different contexts. It was a way to hand family stories down from one generation to another; it was a formal interview documenting a specific event, a formal autobiography, or an informal testimony. Add rapidly developing technologies, and the varieties of oral histories grow even greater (Schrum 500). For example, consider these two quite different scenarios. From 1936-1938 workers in the Federal Writers’ Project interviewed about 2000 ex-slaves, and transcribed those handwritten interviews (Giel 195). Today as part of an oral history archives project called Telling Their Stories, high school students at the Urban School of San Francisco conduct and videotape 2-hour interviews with Bay Area Holocaust survivors in their homes and post them on a public website. Then, too, it wasn’t that long ago that if you talked about using oral histories, you were talking about ordering written transcripts of interviews you discovered by using the index of a printed catalog. You experienced oral history by reading an edited transcript of an interview. But now, with each new technology has come new formats and broader audiences. Radio and Studs Terkel, for example, brought interviews to people who probably never heard the phrase “oral history,” and then videotaping changed things all over again. Back in 1991, Dan Sipe argued that video was underutilized by oral historians. While the use of digital video recording in the field is not yet standard practice, and is still debated by some oral historians and archivists, today’s potential oral history users, like college students, expect to find a streamed video interview by searching Google. In fact, many of today’s oral history projects are being done specifically for the Internet. For example, the Densho Digital Archive of video interviews and other supporting documents and photographs recording the history of Japanese Americans was created with full Internet access in mind (Schrum 508). Smaller projects, like the Urban School of San Francisco’s “Telling Their Stories” mentioned above, are appearing almost daily over the Internet. Despite this trend, the vast majority of oral history collections, in print, audio and video, are still available only at a specific physical location. As Michael Frisch nicely states, “the considerable potential of audio and video documents to support high-impact, vivid, thematic, and analytic engagement with meaningful issues, personalities,', 'year': 2012}, {'paperId': 'f1ffb3e0c9eea5e3f5313ee9ecd1c8ac4365cf65', 'title': 'Fact Checking Father', 'abstract': 'Although Mimi Schwartz is an academic (emerita), Good Neighbors, Bad Times is not an academic book per se. In fact, the book defies generic conventions: it is based in historical fact and on extensive interviews conducted by Schwartz, which are partly cited verbatim in the text, but the historical record and interview materials are embedded in a lyrical narrative that binds past and present, Europe, the US and Israel, and two or three generations. Genre determinations are further confounded by numerous photographs and, on one page, a detailed recipe for making Berches, or potato bread (no explanation for the recipe is given, other than numerous textual references to the bread being eaten). The overall style and eminent readability of the work—it is difficult to put the book down once begun—remind me of Alison Owings’s Frauen: German Women Recall the Third Reich (1995). Like Owings, Schwartz has a talent for interweaving the interview questions and responses in such a fashion that they are in no way tedious (as interview exchanges often can be). In many ways, her quest to discover the truth about her immigrant father’s native village in Germany reads like a detective story. She effectively engages the reader as a co-investigator by constantly inserting metatextual doubts, questions, comments, and reservations about her interviewees’ responses—all clearly marked in italics. The reader is automatically drawn into the author’s asides and cannot help but be caught up in trying to ferret out the truth when multiple, and sometimes contradictory, versions of events are recounted. Already the title of Schwartz’s book suggests the oxymoronic nature of the task the author has set herself: her father repeatedly claimed, as she was growing up in the US, that in his home village in Southern Germany, named Benheim in this book, Christians and Jews lived together peacefully for centuries, and furthermore—and most surprisingly—that the Christians helped their Jewish neighbors during the twelve years of the Third Reich. Since this was a unique story among stories emerging from the Nazi era and the Holocaust, and since the author both wanted and needed her father’s stories to be true, she decided as an adult to pursue them to discover whether they had, in fact, been a true reflection of her father’s life in the village. Her quest takes her from New York to Benheim to Israel, and back and forth again many times, before she feels ready to write the book. She begins by interviewing Jewish survivors from Benheim who emigrated as a group to New York and left Germany early enough in the 1930s not to be deported by the Nazis. These initial contacts, as well as later ones, prove to be serendipitous as the interviewees provide her with an ever-growing list of additional contacts. Schwartz ends up interviewing not only the Benheim émigrés in New York, but also Jews and Christians in Benheim itself and environs, as well as Jewish emigrants who left Benheim as a group and founded a new village in Israel. I was amazed at the breadth of experience represented in her sampling. Toward the end of the book, she also discovers a family of half Jewish children (now adults), who were also part of the larger Benheim story. Schwartz further expands her sample by talking to numerous (adult) children of those who were adults in Benheim during the Nazi era. The result is an extremely comprehensive picture of what happened to the inhabitants of a German village with a considerable Jewish population (30+ percent) during the Third Reich. To contextualize her sample, she also visits two other, somewhat larger villages in the area and compares interviewees’ responses there with those of the Benheimers. I was amazed by the variation in experience, the different kinds of images and events that were retained in people’s memories—sometimes in extraordinary detail, and the interviewees’ readiness to plunge back into dark places of their personal histories. The author must have had a special gift in the realm of interpersonal relations to get people to open up to her the way they do in the interviews. In some cases, interviewees make comments such as, “I have never told anyone this story.”', 'year': 2010}, {'paperId': 'f36863378bb082cc913a9a947ec0d5f66f157e69', 'title': 'Recalling the Survivors: Between Memory and Forgetfulness of Hospitalized Holocaust Survivors in Israel', 'abstract': 'In this article we describe and analyze the attitude and treatment of mentally ill Holocaust survivors in Israel.

Trauma produces excess. Overwhelmed by external stimuli, the traumatized mind cannot process what is happening while it is happening. Trauma\\'s story, then, is not a cohesive narrative of events, but its aftermath of perpetual conflict between denial and telling. The traumatized can never say what happened, yet they never stop trying to say. As traumatologist Judith Herman, M.D.1 explains, trauma \"surfaces not as a verbal narrative but as a symptom\" that at once signals \"the existence of an unspeakable secret and deflect[s] attention from it\" (Trauma and Recovery 1). Trauma sets in motion a vicious cycle that never resolves: trauma erases the possibility of witnessing; yet validating the very occurrence of trauma requires witnessing. In interviewing Holocaust survivors, Dori Laub2 found that \"the very circumstance of being inside the event [. . .] made unthinkable the very notion that a witness could exist.\" No one, neither Nazis nor those they imprisoned, could observe the Holocaust from the outside. There was no outside of its \"coercively totalitarian and dehumanizing framework.\" Indeed, Laub concludes, \"one might say that there was, thus, historically no witness to the Holocaust\" (Laub 66).While Laub speaks to the impossibility of witnessing the Holocaust from the inside, his claim resonates with other historical traumas as well. For example, European colonial expansion across the globe-its settlements, missionaries, and policies of forced assimilation-also rendered witnessing from the inside \"unthinkable\" through its \"totalitarian and dehumanizing framework\" of genocide in the name of civilizing barbarian nations. If traumatic events effectively erase themselves, as Laub suggests, then witnesses exist only outside the events, such as post-event generations carrying the passed-down testimonies of those who survived. Witnessing the witness, that is, may be the only way to tell trauma. Reading traumatic literature is a form of witnessing the (outsider) witness. Even as outsider witnesses (i.e., writers of traumatic literature) and those witnessing them (i.e., readers of traumatic literature) can never get inside of what happened, literature represents trauma as it contends with \"the vexed intersection of facts and meaning, events and narratives\" (Roth 93).3Colonial trauma and Once Were WarriorsOnce Were Warriors, Alan Duff\\'s controversial, bestselling novel about colonial trauma in contemporary Aotearoa New Zealand4 contends with the \"vexed intersection\" of facts (Aotearoa New Zealand\\'s history of Maori subjection to European rule)5 and meaning (what those events signify in a postcolonial nation). As the back cover states, Duff\\'s novel provides \"a harrowing vision of his country\\'s indigenous people two hundred years after the English conquest.\" Set in the fictional Pine Block-a slum on the outskirts of Auckland, New Zealand\\'s largest and most heavily populated metropolitan area-Once Were Warriors depicts the \"harrowing vision\" of one Maori community on the verge of extinction by poverty, abuse, and alcoholism. In portraying trauma\\'s simultaneous past and present presence, the novel offers readers an opportunity to bear witness to post-event generations dwelling both outside and inside of colonial trauma.A prolonged, chronic trauma like colonization involves \"a history of subjection to totalitarian control\" informed by and resulting in genocide (Herman, Trauma and Recovery 121). According to the United Nations, genocide is \"any act committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, national, ethnic, racial or religious groups\" and can include killing, physically harming, and \"inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about physical destruction of the group in whole or in part\" (emphasis added, \"Genocide\"). Traumatic life conditions such as poverty imprison, \"shatter[ing] the attachments of family, friendship, love, and community\" (Herman, Trauma and Recovery 70). …', 'year': 2014}, {'paperId': 'f3a06db13610b24e01b7c404032835478a3cd113', 'title': 'Contextualizing salutogenesis and Antonovsky in public health development.', 'abstract': \"More than 20 years have passed since the American-Israeli medical sociologist Aaron Antonovsky introduced his salutogenic theory 'sense of coherence' as a global orientation to view the world, claiming that the way people view their life has a positive influence on their health.

Frankfurt/M.: Suhrkamp, 2000. 312pp. 12 Euro. This collection of essays based on papers given at a conference, \"Zur Historiographie des Holocaust: Hannah Arendt\\'s `Eichmann in Jerusalem\\' Revisited,\" at the Einstein Forum in Berlin 1996 reflects a variety of perspectives, a few of them yielding new insights and even fewer contributing to a more differentiating historiography of \"the Holocaust.\" Most of these essays document the enduring difficulties of many Jewish readers with Arendt\\'s New Yorker report on the Eichmann trial. Four decades after the book\\'s publication, Arendt\\'s lack of solidarity with \"the Jewish people\" as demonstrated by the \"heartless,\" \"cold,\" \"rationalistic,\" \"profoundly inappropriate\" stylistic and conceptual shape of her argumentation still seems a centrally important issue -- as the critical analysis of unquestioned solidarity was of central importance to Arendt\\'s political essayism. Seyla Benhabib\\'s \"Identitat, Perspektive und Erzahlung in Hannah Arendts Eichmann in Jerusalem\" sharply criticizes Arendt for the confusing stylistic and conceptual hypercomplexity of her discussion of Eichmann\\'s particular criminality and its inherent moral dilemma: the common man and uncommon murderer. Somehow, Eichmann is not worth Arendt\\'s attention because Benhabib is not interested in Arendt\\'s emphasis on understanding and then possibly learning from a historical catastrophe rather than preserving it in ritualized collective memory. Dan Diner\\'s \"Hannah Arendt Reconsidered: Uber das Banale und das Bose in ihrer Holocaust-Erzahlung\" laments her lack of sympathy for East European Jews and the predominantly East European narrative of the Holocaust, and her \"thoughtless and reckless\" accusations of Judenrate (p. 120). Complaining about her alleged tendency to blur the distinction between perpetrator and victim (pp. 122f.), Diner denounces the values of the \"Vernunftzionistin\" Arendt as \"abstract, universal, institutional and therefore republican\" that prevent her from feeling one with (or even close to) the Jewish people as an ethnic entity (pp. 124f.). The general issue of unquestioning Jewish solidarity in reaction to the trauma of Nazi persecution has had a profound impact on its historiography. Annette Wieviorka\\'s argument in \"Die Entstehung des Zeugen\" is very important here and one of the few really useful contributions in its critical analysis of the implications of the chief prosecutor Gideon Hausner\\'s decision to base the dramatic structure of Eichmann\\'s trial on the stories of witnesses rather than the Nazi documents gathered by the Israeli police. He chose them on the basis of their already recorded testimonies and his subsequent interviews with them and choreographed for the \"stage of the world\" their presenting Jewish collective identity in the experience of Nazi persecution, extreme and therefore \"unique\" Jewish victimization. Hausner\\'s assumption had been that this experience could only become \"real\" for the millions of readers, listeners, and viewers if a large number of survivors testified in person and thereby \"individualized\" the sameness of unspeakable persecution. In the act of recitation, however, these stories would not draw on memories \"refreshed\" by the witnesses\\' previously recorded written testimonies as Hausner had hoped. Rather, the stories told by the witnesses at the trial became their memories (pp. 146f.). These memory stories and the modalities of \"performing\" them caused the presence of the witnesses to overwhelm and obscure the presence of the defendant Eichmann. One observer noted that the witnesses were \"the authorized delegates of the Holocaust, they were the facts\" (p. 150). There were very few critical voices like Arendt\\'s that would question the claims made by the organizers of the show trial with respect to its authority to write the history of the persecutions, of that total war, of the twentieth century, of modernity, of mankind. Wieviorka points out rightly that the Eichmann trial \"set free the language of the witnesses,\" helping them to \"achieve their social identity as survivors,\" and the core of this identity was the, as if predestined, calamitous course of history (pp. …', 'year': 2003}, {'paperId': 'f6dd35f695d094a86f984c72a816bae8aac0a844', 'title': 'Coping Action Patterns in Trauma and Other Autobiographic Narratives in Holocaust survivors: A Mixed–Methods Study', 'abstract': 'ABSTRACT In a world where genocides and wars are constant reality, understanding the long-term psychological impact of massive trauma on survivors, as well as identifying ways to promote resilience among them are crucial.

We analyzed 169 thematic units in 20 in-depth interviews with Holocaust survivors using a sequential explanatory mixed-method approach. We found that the proportion of adaptive coping patterns was higher in HN compared to ON, and that the coping category Relatedness, as well as specific individual coping strategies: Self-Reliance, Escape, and Information Seeking occurred more frequently in HN compared to ON, although none of these differences reached statistical significance. A modified interpretative phenomenological approach was used to identify common themes within each coping strategy.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the third generation´s identity and how it is shaped by the memory of the Holocaust, by contemporary antisemitism and by the influence of Jewish institutions.The ethnographic survey, focusing on interviews and observations, revealed that there is a pronounced will to remember the Holocaust. For some, it is important to remember in a private context while others consider that the more public commemoration ceremonies meet the need. At the same time, the grandchildren live in a time of both manifest and latent antisemitism, which influences the formation of their identity and their autobiography. However, their identity is not only shaped by past and present antisemitism but also by the Jewish institutions, the Jewish calendar as well as cultural and socialguidelines. In the conclusions of the study, it can be seen that the Third Generation´s remembrance of the Holocaust is largely based on a generational transfer of memory that has taken place during the participants’ lives through interaction with the survival generation. The results also show that they havestrategies to deal with contemporary alongside historical antisemitism experienced by the survivors. This together constitutes one of the fundaments of both their individual and their collective identity. The results also show that the third generation chooses to live a Jewish life, within the framework of the Jewish congregation in Stockholm, based on individual choices and decisions.

This study affords a rare opportunity to explore language use and trauma using a within-subjects design. Consistent with past research which has shown that cognitive word use typically increases when describing stressful experiences, participants used a higher percentage of cognitive words when describing their Holocaust experiences, in comparison to describing non-Holocaust experiences. Four years after the interviews, participants completed memory questionnaires in relation to their Holocaust experiences and measures of physical health and cognitive functioning. The extent to which participants used an elevated use of insight words when describing their Holocaust experiences 4 years earlier was related to lower ratings of visceral emotional reactions, less avoidance and better lifetime physical health. The results are discussed in terms of how use of cognitive words when describing traumatic memories reflects adaptive psychological and coping processes.

Walzer presents a nightmarish picture of Jewish youths on the brink of destruction throughout their struggle for survival, as well as of the relations that developed between them and their families. Yet, in the author’s opinion, the story of the boys embodies macro-historical themes, such as the stubborn and irrational persistence of the Nazi regime during the last year of its rule. The second part of the book deals mainly with the narrative created after the war’s end, according to the testimonies of children and youth about their fate during the war. Avinoam Patt’s article is different from the others herein. Patt describes the formation of the kibbutzim in the Sosnowiec and Bytom regions and the reasons for the joining of young people from She’erith Hapleitah to these ideological frameworks. The author examines the various considerations facing young survivors and the leaders of the youth movements. The latter wanted to rehabilitate the organizational frameworks that had been liquidated, while many among the surviving youth joined the kibbutzim, even though they were foreign to them from all perspectives, mainly because for them the kibbutzim served as the most appropriate alternative to the family that was lost. A number of articles in the book are devoted to describing the circumstances regarding the collection of testimonies from children and adolescents immediately after the war, and analyzing the difficulties that accompanied them. How was the world of children during the Holocaust presented? What did they remember and what was repressed? How did the adults treat their testimony and how did they interpret it? Questions of this type raised in the context of the nature of the testimonies of Holocaust survivors in general are reinforced when they relate to children and adolescents. Joanna Michilc, who specializes in research on children in the Holocaust (see her Jewish Children in Nazi Occupied Poland, Yad Vashem, 2008), has thoroughly analyzed the difficulties that historians and other researchers have in analyzing these testimonies. Boaz Cohen and Gabriel Finder describe the work of Benjamin Tene, one of the first to show interest in the experiences of Jewish children during the Second World War. In her article, Rita Hurvath analyzes the testimonies of children, especially teenagers, given immediately after the end of the war to the members of Jewish committees who interviewed them. Drawing on various theories about the means of coping immediately with trauma, the author attempts to derive historical meanings from the testimonies as well. The book offers interesting discussions about early and late coping with the traumatic experiences of children and adolescents during and after the Holocaust, both by the survivors themselves and by their caretakers.

The concept of relevance lies at the heart of intellectual access and information retrieval, indeed of reasoning and communication in general; in turn, topical relevance lies at the heart of relevance. The common view of topical relevance is limited to topic matching, resulting in information retrieval systems' failure to detect more complex topical connections which are needed to respond to diversified user situations and tasks. Method. Based on the role a piece of information plays in the overall structure of an argument, we have identified four topical relevance types: Direct, Indirect (circumstantial), Context, and Comparison. In the process of creating a speech retrieval test collection, graduate history students made 27,000 topical relevance assessments between Holocaust survivor interview segments and real user topics, using the four relevance types, each on a scale of 0 - 4. They recorded justifications for their assessments and kept detailed Topic Notes. Analysis. We analysed these relevance assessments using a grounded theory approach to arrive at a finer classification of topical relevance types. Results. For example, indirect relevance(a piece of information is connected to the topic indirectly through inference, circumstantial evidence) was refined to Generic Indirect Relevance, Backward Inference (abduction), Forward Inference (deduction), and Inference from Cases (induction), with each subtype being further illustrated and explicated by examples. Conclusion. Each of these refined types of topical relevance plays a special role in reasoning, making a conclusive argument, or performing a task. Incorporating them into information retrieval systems allows users more flexibility and a better focus on their tasks. They can also be used in teaching reasoning skills.\", 'year': 2006}, {'paperId': 'f915bf49ec55f32ae312dfc735cd660bc519046c', 'title': 'Leader in Addictions Nursing Education', 'abstract': 'Biosketch: Edith Heinemann Harris, R.N., M.A., F.A.A.N., is professor emerita of psychosocial nursing, University of Washington at Seattle.

Drawing from a rich menu of interviews with prominent musicians, scholars, critics, and Holocaust survivors, Nupen presents an intriguing investigation of music’s power and meaning. We Want the Light originated as an hour-long 2003 special for the BBC. The 2009 two-DVD set begins with that BBC special, a well-crafted documentary which falls into three parts: 1) German history and Jewish assimilation; 2) Richard Wagner’s influence; and 3) the fallout from Hitler’s adoption of Wagner. Nupen tells this story through interviews, musical performances, and primary source readings. Underscoring it all are extended excerpts from various composers ranging from Bach to Brahms to Franz Waxman. Nupen covers a lot of historical ground and manages to find the right balance of scholarly context, musical reflection, and colorful (often heartbreaking) anecdotes from the survivors. The images throughout We Want the Light are mainly of the interviewees, but Nupen also incorporates excellent live performance footage, most of which effectively focuses our attention on the music rather than the technique or personality of the performer(s). Also included is a rare clip from a concert in Rishon LeZion, Israel in which the Israel Symphony attempts to perform Wagner’s Siegfried Idyll over the protests of an angry listener shaking a rattle. Nupen concludes the first DVD by presenting the entire documentary soundtrack again but without interviews or narration; the images here are drawn almost completely from live performances. As Nupen notes in the DVD introduction, the documentary repeatedly emphasizes music’s ability to communicate more vividly than words. The separate music track, recorded in Dolby Digital 5.1, is intended to encourage viewers to return to the music itself and reflect on the context We Want the Light has just described. On the second DVD, Nupen presents extended clips from the eighteen interviews he conducted for the documentary. Included is a stunning performance by Evgeny Kissin, whose interview did not make the final cut, but whose playing of the slow movement from Brahms Piano Sonata in F minor, Op. 5 powerfully captures Nupen’s overarching point that music, though abstract and imprecise, has the ability to cut deep into our emotional being. This is Nupen’s tenth documentary, all now available on DVD. His earlier projects focused on performers (Segovia, Kissin, Perlman, du Pré, Milstein, Ashkenazy), or composers (Schubert and Sibelius), so We Want the Light cuts a new path, and in doing so confirms Nupen’s mastery of the classical music documentary. The sound quality and image clarity are excellent. The DVD menus are thorough, clearly organized, and easily navigated. We Want the Light is intended for general audiences, but will also be of great use to specialists in Wagner, the Holocaust, German history, political music, and even documentary film production.', 'year': 2010}, {'paperId': 'f9755844413ea0fa5c863943b964bcfa5f210e50', 'title': 'Monuments, Memorial Sites, and Commemoration Sites, Recount History', 'abstract': 'Over time, the live memories of survivors have disappeared, and it has become clear that the memory of the Jewish Holocaust could disappear entirely in the absence of institutional efforts to preserve it. The understanding that collective memory can be preserved only through proactive efforts led to the development of formal and informal curricula for Holocaust education. The main assumption is that Holocaust education has the potential to generate a moral transformation. In light of this conclusion the question is: What kind of changes do we seek and how should we accomplish them? This study deals with a case study of one of the constitutive historical events of the 20th century: commemoration of the Holocaust. The study focuses on the Experiential Learning Method of educating about Holocaust remembrance and commemoration and about Holocaust monuments. Over the years memorial centers have been added, which contain additional monuments commemorating the story of a specific place and/or personal stories. One of the currently customary methods of commemoration in Israel is the journey to Poland, to the labor, concentration, and death camps, to the various memorial sites and monuments. This journey is undertaken by young and old, groups and singles, from all over the world and particularly from Israel. Since many of those taking the journey are young people at an age when personal, national, and historical identity is formed, a time when the young acquire their educational values, it is particularly important to ascertain who is charged with passing on the beacon of memory. This leads to weighty questions regarding the identity of the guides who lead these journeys and the contents they choose to impart to the participants, the guidance sites, and the method of guidance. Who will tell the story? How will the story be told? What will remain of the story? This study discusses in addition, a case study of guides from Israel charged with imparting this chapter of human history. In order to explore their impact, interviews were held with 47 guides, the large majority of whom are Israeli born, a majority academics, and many hold advanced degrees. The research findings indicate that they aim the commemoration beacon primarily at guidance sites in Poland. The study explored other diverse essential parameters regarding the profile of “guides to Poland” – where did they study? What is their personal affiliation with the subject? What is their position on the universal and Jewish narrative of the Holocaust? In light of the interviews conducted, it appears that almost all of them have the necessary tools to convey the most complete and comprehensive educational message. Accordingly, this issue was explored and most of the guides reported that the most influential message of commemoration is conveyed primarily through visits to camps and ghettos in Poland. This conclusion generates a theoretical, practical, philosophical, moral, and educational question indicating the “exporting of historical memory”. Should our entire educational focus indeed be exclusively on Poland? How can we preserve the ethos of the affiliation between the Holocaust of the Jews and heroism in the Holocaust, as well as heroism in Israel and its building, if we disregard the many commemoration and memorial sites within Israel? Do the journeys to the camps and to the valley of death in Poland, which are led by these guides, not create a distortion in the instilling of Holocaust remembrance and heritage, by disregarding the many commemoration sites and monuments throughout Israel? Aiming the beacon of commemoration at Poland, outside Israel, prevents exposure of the public, and particularly teenagers, to the natural association formed in Israel between Holocaust and revival, which preserves the connecting link between the generations.', 'year': 2022}, {'paperId': 'f9bc1a8e4ef19fbc17f06457ef43db2d0dc34bde', 'title': 'When Is an Interview an Interview?

So in effect many cancer patients constrict their fantasy, affect, and feeling, almost withdrawing emotionally, and externalize their feelings such as by blaming everything and everyone else such as doctors who made a delayed or wrong diagnosis, the hospital, the family, an injury that they believe caused the cancer, etc. Bahnson goes on to present his observations on a few patients that he has seen who suffered both types of trauma, holocaust survivors, who in recent years developed cancer. He showed that these patients had first to deal with the \"unfinished business\" of true mourning, with all the rage and frustration that had never really been expressed towards their persecutors in the war, before they could begin to deal with the present threat of anihilation from their own bodies. That paper is followed by another clear and well-written paper from Hertz on \"Homesickness and Psychosomatic Disease\", and after that it is predominantly downhill. A series of papers on Anorexia Nervosa by the Touyz group from Australia is disappointing from a country that is usually associated with higher quality work. In one of their papers, on patients\\' impressions of their own body image via various test procedures, the authors note that \"none of the control subjects was able to judge herself accurately\"! This lends some confirmation towards a clinical impression that I have long held and found quite useful in confrontation in psychotherapy, that almost all women do not see themselves accurately, though most do not take it to the extent of the distortion of the anorexic. Heigl-Evers and Rosin try to compare a traditional psychoanalytic interview with what they call an interactional approach, and offer us some hypothesized dialogue that more resembles a parody or comedy skit than a patient being interviewed by a competent dynamic psychotherapist. Doerr-Zegers et al. in attempting to analyze some family data in Anorexia Nervosa demonstrate one really important finding in their observations on a limited number of patients. In 18 out oftheir 20 patients the onset of Anorexia Nervosa was preceded by what they described as a \"striking life event\", such as illness or death of a parent, or even a failure on the part of the patient to succeed in a significant endeavour such as an examination. Ramsay writes a good review of the topic of pain, but unfortunately the book is brought to an end by three very weak papers from Greek authors looking at Psychosomatic aspects in the year 2000. Psychotherapy and Psychosomatic Medicine have not usually been considered to be areas in which progress has been rapid and dramatic and therefore the fact that this congress took place more than four years ago is not necessarily a deterrent to perusing this book. Any reader should find something of value, but I doubt that anyone will be overly impressed with the standard as a whole. I suspect that most of the contributors are research psychiatrists and that many do very little or no psychotherapy themselves. To say then that this is the \"state of the art\" in terms of these areas of clinical psychiatry would not be fair, certainly not in the North American context. To suggest that this is the \"state of the art\" in terms of research psychiatry may also not be quite accurate from our North American perspective, but there is certainly the possibility that this book reflects the \"state of the art\" in terms of work in many other countries, and that in itself is worthy of our attention.', 'year': 1988}, {'paperId': 'fa1bf57985de2aacb34f3a8168460e963b2445af', 'title': 'The Collective Memory Reader', 'abstract': \"PREFACE AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS INTRODUCTION: JEFFREY K.

In other words, recognizing the positionality of oneself as the interviewer, and being “attentive to the thinking being who is coping with her or his life” (p. 34) constitute a productive relationship between the interviewer and the interviewee. Being attentive to “life”—and not just “survival”—is key to this principle. Walke considers it her ethical duty to let her interviewees narrate the entirety of their lives, their Soviet lives, and remember their childhoods, the war, and the postwar period, as they make sense of them in the post-Soviet world. Recognizing their “complex and often contradictory attempts ... to integrate ... is crucial to understanding the Jewish condition in the Soviet Union.” For this reason, the author chose to speak with pioneers and partisans who had not left the country after the war, and who attempted, in the words of Veena Das, to “occupy the space of devastation by making it one’s own, not through a gesture of escape but by occupying it in its present-ness” (p. 15). This method allows the author not only to point us to important historical insights about the Holocaust in Soviet Belorussia, but also to render, through her conversations in situ, the “destruction and its effects visible, [in] an attempt to ensure that destruction is not complete” (p. 27). Oral history thus becomes the ethical work of Holocaust memory and remembrance. Pioneers and Partisans is an excellent contribution to the history and memory of the Holocaust in the Soviet Union, a book whose author has pondered thoughtfully the ethical and political implications of her scholarship. It addresses complex theoretical concerns without sacrificing narrative flow. That is a difficult task for any author, and Anika Walke has accomplished it beautifully.', 'year': 2019}, {'paperId': 'fc581164e95551e8fbc2f81f9dc8963114241f3c', 'title': 'Let Them Speak: An Effort to Reconnect Communities of Survivors in a Digital Archive', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2020}, {'paperId': 'fcca319d62c163fc44f47dcb363b35bb5ce9d589', 'title': 'The Shaping of Military Nursing in Israel: 1947–1958', 'abstract': 'Abstract:Unique realities influenced the development of the military nursing profession in Israel.

       "  'abstract': 'Tra la fine del 1944 e l’inizio del 1945 migliaia di giovani donne dai 15 anni in su, incluse donne incinte, furono deportate dall’Ungheria orientale verso campi di lavoro sovietici. Furono vittime innocenti, per “essere state nel posto sbagliato al momento sbagliato”. Per periodi dai due ai quattro anni furono obbligate a vivere nelle condizioni più primitive ed atroci, lavorando in miniere di carbone ed in fattorie collettive. La maggior partesi queste donne non sopravvisse. Quelle che vi riuscirono ritornarono con infermità e malattie fisiche e psicologiche che le afflissero per il resto della vita. Al loro ritorno furono trattate dal regime comunista come criminali di guerra ed ebbero enormi difficoltà nel trovare lavoro. Per oltre quarant’anni fu proibito loro di parlare delle loro terribili esperienze. Fu soltanto dopo la fine del regime comunista, quando il loro destino fu rivelato grazie ad interviste e studi pubblicati in Ungheria, che poterono ottenere risarcimenti. The countless number of lives lost during World War II and the displacement of millions from their native lands are among the most tragic events in the history of the twentieth century. According to experts, the past century proved to be the most violent and the bloodiest one hundred years in human history, an assertion convincingly substantiated by scholars, researchers, and journalists who have published scores of books and articles about civilian and military victims of both world wars. Special emphasis has been put on victims of the Second World War, * The essay, which has been partly updated, has already been published on S. B. Várdy T.H. Tooley A. H. Várdy, Ethnic Cleansing in Twentieth-Century Europe, Columbia University Press, New York 2003, pp. 503-516. ** Agnes Huszár Várdy, Ph.D. is a former Professor of Communications and Literature at Robert Morris University and currently Adjunct Professor in the English Department at Duquesne University. She is the author, co-author, and co-editor of eight volumes and over eighty-five articles and essays, among them two books on Austro-German Romanticism, more specifically on two Romantic poets, Nikolaus Lenau and Karl Beck, and a social-historical novel, Mimi, used in history and literature courses at several American universities. A few years ago, along with her husband, Dr. Steven B. Várdy of the Dept. of History at Duquesne University, she began to do research on forced labor camps, known as the Gulag, in the former Soviet Union. Two of their books have already appeared on the subject: Stalin’s Gulag: the Hungarian Experience (Oriental University, Naples, 2007) pp. 203 and Magyarok a Gulag Rabszolgatáboraiban [Hungarians in Gulag Slave Labor Agnes Huszár Várdy DEP n.7 / 2007 89 especially Hitler’s crusade against the Jewish population in the countries occupied by the Third Reich. Efforts to inform the general public about the horrors of the Jewish Holocaust have been especially successful and have led to widespread knowledge about these events among practically all the nations of the world. This level of historical awareness does not exist for most other ethnic groups and nationalities whose lives were adversely affected by World War II. Millions of non-Jews were forced to endure previously unheard of deprivation and hardship, before, during, and after the war. Compared to the extensive investigation of the Jewish Holocaust, historical research has paid little attention to the lot of other victimized groups. Relatively little has been written about them, and as a result, these events have failed to become common knowledge. The fate of those who fled their native lands in Eastern and Central Europe in fear of the invading Soviet Army, and later settled in Western Europe, or immigrated to North or South America, has not been adequately researched. Not much is known about the victims of forced population expulsions and ethnic cleansing, such as the sixteen million Germans who were expelled from Poland and Czechoslovakia (from former East and West Prussia, Pomerania, Silesia and the Sudetenland). In the same vein, with the exception of Hungarian scholars, the general public is not aware of the retribution suffered by about 120,000 ethnic Hungarians who were driven across the Danube from Slovakia to Hungary as a consequence of the Beneš Decrees. Furthermore, knowledge about Stalin’s extermination of close to fifty Camps], Kairosz, Budapest 2007, pp. 370. She has recently completed a novel entitled My Italian Summer, and is currently working on a sequel to her novel Mimi. 1 For an excellent summary of this mass cruelty, see Norman M. Naimark, Fires of Hatred: Ethnic Cleansing in Twentieth-Century Europe, Cambridge, Mass., 2001. 2 One of the most authoritative standard works (among many hundreds) on the Jewish Holocaust is still Raul Hilberg’s The Destruction of the European Jewry, Chicago, 1961. See also the highly regarded work on the largest death camp, Debórah Dwork and Robert Jan van Pelt, Auschwitz: 1270 to the Present, New York, 1996. On the Hungarian segment of the Jewish Holocaust, see Randolph L. Graham’s massive synthesis, The Politics of Genocide: The Holocaust in Hungary, 2 vols., New York, 1981; and Randolph L. Braharn and Béla Vágó eds., The Holocaust in Hungary Forty Years Later, New York, 1985. A classic Hungarian-language summary is Jenõ Lévai, Zsidósors Magyarországon [Jewish Fate in Hungary], Budapest, 1948. See also the documentary collection: Vádirat a nácizmus ellen. Dokumentumok a magyarországi zsidóüldözések történetéhez [Indictment of Nazism. Documents on the History of the Persecution of the Jews in Hungary], ed. Ilona Benoschofsky and Elek Karsai, 3 vols., Budapest, 1958-1967. 3 On the Beneš Decrees, as they relate to the Hungarians, see Robert Barta, The Hungarian-Slovak Population Exchange and Forced Resettlement in 1947, and Edward Chászár, Ethnic Cleansing in Slovakia: The Plight of the Hungarian Minority, in the present volume, which also contains a list of the Beneš Decrees in the Appendix. According to Barrel, originally 73.187 Hungarians were slated for expulsion on the basis of the parity list. An additional 106.398 were to be expelled as “major war criminals” and 1.927 as “minor war criminals”. Had this been implemented a total of 181.512 would have been expelled. But the Czechoslovak government was not satisfied even with these numbers. It turned to the Peace Conference and demanded approval for expulsion of an additional 200.000 Hungarians. These goals, however, were not allowed to be implemented, and thus by April 10, 1948, only 68.407 Hungarians were officially resettled in Hungary. Continued illegal expulsions, however, almost doubled this number, for according to the Hungarian census of 1949 at least 119.000 of these expellees were living in Hungary. Cf. I. Romsics, Magyarország története a XX. században [Hungary’s History in the Twentieth Century], Budapest 1999, p. 302. Agnes Huszár Várdy DEP n.7 / 2007 90 million of his own “compatriots”, including Russians and many other ethnic groups and nationalities, is limited. His victims included Poles, Ukrainians, Baltic peoples, Crimean Tatars, and many others who were exterminated by the millions. Yet, knowledge about the fate of these peoples is not widespread, at least not, to the extent to which the horrors of the Jewish Holocaust has permeated the historical consciousness of the broader public. It is evident that the victims of war and prejudice, misery, and extermination mentioned above have not attracted the same degree of interest of experts, researchers, and journalists. As a result, a gigantic gap of public ignorance and misinformation exists regarding these shocking events, both in Europe and the United States. The lives and fate of foreign victims of Soviet forced labour camps also falls into the category of “the little known”. Insofar as historically aware individuals in Western Europe and North America have given the whole issue any thought, most have assumed that only POWs and members of the armed forces of the defeated nations were deported to the Soviet Union after World War II. This assumption could not be further from the truth. In the case of Hungary, it was only after the demise of Communism in 1989-1990 that researchers, journalists, and political leaders could begin to focus on the fate of the several hundred-thousand Hungarian civilians, including innocent women and children, who were deported to forced labour camps after the Soviet invasion of Hungary in September 1944. It is virtually impossible to uncover the full details about these deportations, but the publication of several studies based on memoirs, diaries, and interviews of survivors provides a vast amount of information that contributes substantially to our knowledge of these tragic events. These include published works by Tamás Stark, György Dupka, Péter Rózsa, Janos Rózsás, Zoltán Szente, Mihály Herczeg, and Zsolt Csalog; the memoirs of Imre Badzey and Mrs. Sándor Mészáros; and the documentary films of Sándor Sára and the Gulyás brothers. Two volumes of interviews collected by Ilona Szebeni and Valéria Kormos document the fate of 4 See the relevant studies in the present volume by Alexander V. Prusin on the Poles, and Brian Blyn Williams on the Crimean Tatars. 5 According to Tamás Stark, since the collapse of the Communist regime in 1989 1990, about two dozen memoirs and collections of memoirs have appeared in print.

The research study aimed to give this specific group of survivors a voice and to explore the impact of multiple extreme traumas, the Holocaust and childhood sexual abuse, on the survivors. Twenty-two child survivors of the Holocaust who were sexually abused during the war completed open-ended interviews. The data was qualitatively analyzed according to Tutty, Rothery, and Grinnell's (1996) guidelines. Three major themes were found: issues relating to the sexual abuse trauma, survivors' perceptions of the abuse, and survivors' general perspectives towards life. The identity of the offenders, Jewish or non-Jewish, determined the survivors' feelings towards themselves, the perpetrators, and about the worth of life.\",\n",
