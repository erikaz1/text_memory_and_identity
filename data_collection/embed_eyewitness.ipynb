       "'Refugee Number 11 in Switzerland 1938 – 1943. Experiences of an Austrian emigrant. I was invited by a Swiss friend to spend two to three weeks holiday in Ascona and left Vienna on 7th March 1938. I had no idea, that I wouldn’t see our flat, our home again. (My father was a doctor and died in 1936) On 11th March I heard on the radio in Ascona that German troops had crossed the Austrian border. I decided, if possible, not to return to Austria. After ten days in Ticino, I went to Zurich to find out what might happen to me in the future. I contacted the “Kultusgemeinde” and Dr. Sutro-Katzenstein. I was registered as refugee No. 11 but I didn’t want support although I hadn’t had much money. I asked for addresses where I could work unofficially. I was able to eke out a living with administrative work, as a cleaner, chef and a nanny. An acquaintance helped me to find a small basement flat and I came out with Fr. 150,- per month. I was very worried about my mother and two brothers who were still in Vienna. One of them was also a doctor and the other one a Dr. juris who worked as an editor with a newspaper. (On a separate sheet I will tell briefly the story of my mother and my brothers, so far I can remember.) In the beginning the Swiss were decent to me (because I went as a tourist into their country!) but from March 1939 I had attend several summons and they advised me to go back to Austria. When I explained I couldn’t go back because I’m Jewish they recommended that I emigrate to France or overseas because I was only allowed to stay in the country for 12 months. In the meantime, my brother the doctor and his bride, who were in political danger, received an American affidavit and got the entry clearance to Switzerland for the transition period until emigration. In June 1938 we met in Zurich. He had to leave Switzerland soon after (see attachment) and went to Liechtenstein. From there he emigrated to the U.S.A. at the beginning of August 1939. As a result of recommendations I was able to get in touch with a lawyer from Geneva, who got two visas to Cuba for my mother and my second brother. Both could come on to Switzerland in July 1939 and they got their residence permit in Geneva. But they rejected my applications to renew my residence permit in Switzerland twice. It was also not possible to get onto the quota for the U.S.A because I fell on the Romanian side as I was born in Chernivtsi. My mother and brothers, all born in Vienna, came therefore on the Austrian quota which was much better. They were all already registered in Vienna for emigration but up to then only my brother, the doctor, had received an affidavit and without this Switzerland would not give the permit to immigrate, for a further emigration to America. So there was no possibility to cross the border illegally to Annecy, France at the beginning of August 1939 because my deportation was set for mid July. But I wanted to meet my mother and my second brother who were not able to go to Geneva before end of July 1939. In Annecy they declined my application for residence permit because there was no “J” in my passport. (I left Austria as a tourist!) and they thought me a bit “louche”. I felt under observation and without rights and therefore uncomfortable. In Annecy I worked as a kitchen assistant and was able to scratch a living. Later they advised me to go to Nice where an officer gave residence permits. I arrived there at the end of August and experienced a few days later the beginning of World War II. in Nice. Friends advised me to go to the middle of France because it was possible that the Italian border would be bombed. I was able to escape with the last train to Vichy. It was not possible to get a residence permit in Nice because the officer who was responsible was not working there anymore. I finally got the legal residence permit in Vichy through connections in the “Kultusgemeinde”. I was helping in the household of a Jewish family and so I managed to eke out a living. But very soon the situation became “uncomfortable” for Jewish people. They started to collect the men of emigrant families in camps, the authorities were getting more unfriendly, the “Drôle de Guerre” appeared to be scary. They suspected the most horrible things, you could hear opinions like “Hitler will coming to this place too.“ - “We have to go farther.” - “They willarrestand bring us to Germany.” - shortly, I sent a call for help to my brother in Geneva and finally he was able to find a very nice young person who agreed - without money considerations! - to enter a fictitious marriage with me. Because of this marriage the Swiss authorities gave me entry clearance but it was very difficult to get the exit permit from France. But with the help of a deputy it worked out at the last minute. In March 1940 I could go to Switzerland and embrace my mother in Geneva. Very soon the German offensive started in France and during this time Vichy was occupied and the emigrants, who were living there were deported to Germany. In Switzerland I “married” Mr. B. 10 days later and got Swiss papers - a really big moment! As a Swiss I was allowed to work and was able to work my way from a cleaner to an office assistant, to a secretary and then up to a Journalist. I moved to Berne where I remained. My “husband” had a small Job in Geneva but lost it soon afterwards. Later he was engaged in political work which provided a pretext for a divorce. This was finalised one year later. I don’t want to mention the difficulties, investigations, summons etc. of the Swiss authorities as a result of the divorce. In Bern I met my current husband who I married in April 1943. So my migrations found a happy end and I had a home again. In the meantime in America, my brother, the doctor was able to send my mother and brother in Geneva affidavits from the U.S.A and they prepared for their departure. My mother, a tender, sickly person was afraid of the new move, especially of the final goodbye to Europe. But the Swiss authorities and the Jewish centres in Geneva pressed for her emigration. So, she and my brother went by train to Spain at the beginning of August 1941 to travel on the “Navemare”, the notorious emigrant ship to the United States. After their arrival in Barcelona my mother got seriously ill and had a total breakdown. My brother, who had to go on with his journey, was desperate and sent me a wire: ”Take mother back”. But I neither hadn’t got the money for such a journey nor the time because I had to work hard. I went in desperation to the aliens’ police and told them mother’s terrible situation. For the first and only time I met an official in Switzerland who was a real angel in person. He said literally: “I’ll just assume that’smymother”. He gave instruction that a police officer, who regularly accompanied the emigrant groups from Switzerland to Port Bout, receive my mother there and to bring her back to Switzerland. And this really happened. I could welcome my seriously ill mother a few days later in Berne and had the luck to take care of her during the whole of war time. Later my husband (“aryan”, Swiss and Protestant) took care of her too and we had both the good feeling of making her life, as far as possible, bearable. She was suffering badly with the seperation from her sons and had difficulties even to live in the German part of Switzerland. She longed for her Vienna and the grave of my father. My second brother was able to come to Switzerland directly after the war to see her again. She died in January 1948. Her grave is in the Israeli graveyard in Berne. (Mrs. E. P., born in Vienna 1876, died in Berne 1948) Regarding: my brother Dr. H. P. (born in Vienna 1901) He was a doctor in a sanatorium near Vienna and had to leave the house within 10 hours and was only allowed to take few things with him. Each day he slept over at different acquaintances because directly after the initiation of the Hitler regime the prosecution of Jewish doctors of his year in Vienna started immediately. Finally, he received permission to leave Vienna with his bride immediately after receiving a summons at theGestapo. It seems that some high-positioned Nazi, a former patient of my father, intervened in this matter. So, he came to Switzerland where he and his bride lived on the proceeds of their sold jewellery. To earn a living in the USA, he did a dental technician course which he paid for himself! After one week of training with a dental technician in Zurich, the Swiss authorities forced him to leave the country within 24 hours because he disobeyed the ban “not to work”!! He was able to receive permission for himself and his fiancee to stay in Vaduz (Liechtenstein) until his emigration to the States, where he worked as a doctor after he passed the exams. Regarding: Dr. F. P. (born in Vienna 1903) It was more difficult for my second brother as a lawyer. During his one year with my mother in the Tuscany he did casual work in the countryside, translations and language lessons. Later he was not allowed to work in Switzerland and was supported along with my mother by the “Kultusgemeinde” in Geneva. His worst experience was his journey on the “Navemare” to the United States from Spain which was an old, shabby ship. Though Jewish helping assistance organisations paid large amounts for these journeys, it was overloaded and dirty, without the simplest hygenic facilities and with not enough food. On this passage some people died because of exhaustion and hunger, among them Mrs. Prof. Arthur Schnitzler from Vienna who was buried on the Bermudas. My brother arrived after 5 weeks (via Cuba) in America having lost 12 kg. During the first days he was cared by my older brother. At the beginning he worked as a casual worker in a factory, later he worked as a packer and decorator and took courses in his spare time at the Boston University for public- and human relations’ and now he is a manager of a large company.'"

      "As a Refugee in Belgium from 1937 until 1947 Written from memory for Oliver and Leonor, beginning of February 1958. I left Germany in a hurry from Berlin in 1937 to save myself from Hitler after I had house searches and interrogations behind me in our country house in western Germany. I succeeded in reaching the Belgium border without suspicion with the help of friends in Essen, where I went into hiding for 8 days. I arrived in Belgium, where I had friends and relatives, with a feeling of relief to have escaped the danger. They helped me to find a small apartment and I furnished it with the necessary furniture with their help. My cousin, who ran a women’s clothing workshop with her daughter, gave me work: I had to visit emigrants with material samples and drawings, and after they had decided on the material and style, take measurements to get the work done for the dress or coat; and once ready take finished articles to the customers. This work was bound up with anxiety and a feeling of insecurity for me because I had in my visa “for tourists” from the Belgian authorities the stamp: “Non travail” (no working). So, it could happen that a policeman, of whom there were many, who was observantly surveying the street, could ask me because I had a small suitcase with me and I was not permitted to take paid work. After I was about a year in Brussels, I was expecting my son Erhart, your uncle. When I left Germany, he escaped, after a bad interrogation by the “Gestapo” (German Secret Police) to Basel in Switzerland, where he was able to stay at first and enrol as a student. He lived with the private secretary of the “League for Human Rights”. He had received his doctorate in sociology the year before at the university of Berlin. My late husband, Dr. E.L., your grandfather, had been in his day on the board of the “League for Human Rights”. In the years after Hitler’s seizure of power in Germany, they were in Switzerland frequently reserved and almost antagonistically disposed towards refugees from Germany, and demanded amongst other things, his certificate of family origins which understandably he could not provide. In Belgium, Erhart was only able to stay for a limited time if he undertook the commitment to work for 6-8 months in a so-called “retraining factory for mechanical metal working”. - 2 – Professor Schlesinger from Berlin, the inventor of important machines, had brought this factory into being with the Jewish Committee of Brussels to give Jewish refugees from Germany the possibility of at first being able to do mechanical work when they emigrate to South America until they could get a better occupation. We lived in Uccle which lay outside of the inner city. It is the “Till Eulenspiegel “of Brussels of the Middle Ages. Erhard had to get up at 5 AM to get to the factory on time. In the factory they were taught by Belgian master tradesmen in metal work and plumbing, and they were taught by a teacher in Spanish which was necessary for South America. Those who were retraining came together from many occupations and for many it was difficult to learn Spanish. For Erhart, who knew Latin the source of the language, it was easy, so he could help many in private. Because many Jewish emigrants could not help themselves, Erhard helped them often in the evenings and prepared compositions for them on his typewriter with input and other things. After 7 weeks, Erhard had to leave Brussels, to travel via Paris and Marseille to Bolivia with some hundreds of other refugees from the training school factory. They boarded in Marseille a veteran Italian steamship which up to that time had taken Italian troops to Abyssinia and they were not allowed once during the journey that lasted several weeks, even cooped up in the most ferocious heat, to leave the ship to walk upon dry land. After a journey lasting several weeks, through the Mediterranean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Panama Canal and the Pacific Ocean, they arrived at the Chilean port of Africa, from where they took the mountain train to La Paz, the capital of Bolivia. Erhart quickly found a position as a teacher in Tarija, a provincial city in southern Bolivia, where he spent 7 successful years in a state school as a teacher of physics. The outbreak of a revolution there by Bolivian fascists, who worked with the same methods as in Berlin in Germany, forced Erhart to leave Tarija. After a very difficult struggle to survive in La Paz, your uncle Erhard left Bolivia after almost 14 years to go to England. He now occupies a position as a teacher in a Secondary Modern School in the north of England in a mining area in County Durham. After Erhart was away from Brussels for a year, England had to declare war on Hitler because of the German invasion of Poland, and Hitler’s soldiers were soon set in motion towards Belgium, Holland and France. - 3 – They came nearer and nearer, and we heard the canon fire becoming ever clearer. A mood of panic seized the Belgians. Everyone wanted to leave the city of Brussels to flee to France. Moreover, a speaker on the balcony of the French consulate informed the people that everyone could come to France. They had enough accommodation and food! In next to no time, the large city of Brussels was lonely and abandoned. The shutters went down one after the other in the businesses. Those who did not own a car, rented one, or a van or a cart or a bicycle or something similar. In the end, thousands of francs were offered for a car. My Belgian cousin fled with her 80-year-old mother and her daughters on a bicycle, upon which she later put her old mother and pushed to move onwards. Even in our house which had 3 floors, everyone rushed away except an old couple: the house owner was an architect who had a kitchen and living room in the basement of the house and a bedroom on the first floor. They were an extremely friendly couple who had considered me from the outset as belonging to the family. I always had to drink coffee with them if I ever went down into the beautiful big garden to enjoy all the beautiful bushes and the old trees and flowers. Their kitchen lay in the basement. Then, one day, Monsieur Guerard suddenly came in, pale, and read to us a copy of a poster which the Maison Communal in Uccle had created. The contents read: “Il est possible ...“ “It is possible that the enemy will enter our city ... The citizens are requested not to open any windows and to behave very calmly.” Scarcely had we heard this when the young nephew of Mr. Guerard, a 21-year-old soldier, came in, in a Belgium uniform covered in dirt and mud, and said: “We have had to give up. We, and King Leopold (the father of the present king Baudouin) have recently been without “de l’eau potable” drinking-water; behind us were thousands of women with children and they were dying of thirst.” At this time, I was still selling clothes in Antwerp for my cousin which were ready with me in Brussels for delivery. I followed my instinct and travelled to Antwerp, and went to my friends, Dr. R’s, where I often stayed overnight if it was too late, to explain what was taking place in Brussels. We lay in bed as usual and were awoken around 5 in the morning by two terrible, severe bomb blasts. We jumped out of bed and hurried to the window. - 4 – There we saw two huge columns of fire soaring up in the square in front of our towerblock, which lay a bit outside of the city. We heard outside the shouts: “the Germans are coming. They are on their way to Brussels.” Dr. R. went into the city for information about what was happening and came back. “All strangers must register in the town hall; you too Selmken; you are now staying here with us.” I replied: “I am travelling back to Brussels immediately. I will have difficulties here because I am registered in Uccle (Brussels).” Richard said: “You cannot travel anymore. No civilian can go on the trains, only soldiers.” I said: “I will go and see and try” and went quickly to the station. A train stood there which was going to Brussels and was full of soldiers. I went to a compartment and said: “Je vous emprie – (please), let me in. I have to get home.” They were all friendly: “Entrez!  .. come in“. Fortunately, I met again my Guerards again in Brussels. I was spared a lot as a result of not staying in Antwerp because all non-Belgians, including Dr. R’s entire family, were ordered to make their way to Limburg where they had to stay for many months. Their train to Limburg stayed for several days of the journey on the track because the personnel had left the it. The situation was there were adults and women with small children, who had no food with them, so that the women had to fetch children’s milk and a variety of food in the villages that surrounded the track to Limburg. Apparently, the Belgian personnel had lost their heads in the general confusion. In the meantime, the Belgian immigration authorities were also active. All foreign men had to leave Belgium and were transported to the South of France where they were accommodated in internment camps and where later when France fell into the hands of Hitler, many were unlucky enough to be transported to Poland from where they never returned. In this way, four of my acquaintances also never came back. On the morning of my return from Antwerp, I was woken around 5 AM in the morning by the clip-clop of horses and noise in the street. I looked out of my window on the top floor and there flowed a stream of German soldiers in greenish uniforms and with canvasses over the artillery carried as the colours of the waves in the sea – green with brown and white foam. A group danced inside the column with open umbrellas upon which the words “Chamberlain’s umbrella” were written. That referred to the fact that Chamberlain to Hitler at Berchtesgaden with an umbrella, to save peace at the last moment. The column finished around 1 PM. - 5 – I went into the city where more and more German soldiers, mainly on bicycles, appeared. The uniforms were like those of the English and American soldiers who had left the city some days before. Many Germany soldiers got off their bicycles to speak in a friendly manner to the few who passed by: “We are only travelling through here; we want to go to England.” Frau Guerard said:” That’s what you said in 1914 and then you stayed here for 4 years.” This time they stayed for 4 ½ years. The city made a very abandoned impression because all the blinds over the shop windows were closed and they were scarcely anybody going on the streets. It stayed like that for around 3 weeks. Then, the first Belgian citizens came back from their flight to France. None of them went far over the border. The refugees went into different battle zones. None went forwards; they moved in circles. They had to fetch food from farmers which they then cooked and prepared in the open air. My cousin, Claire B., had to sleep overnight in sand-dunes on the coast because she could not get a room in the place. During the night she heard wounded and dying soldiers wailing and groaning “Mummy, Mummy”. It had been ghoulish. My friend L’s, who took flight by car and with work tools, had to leave everything behind when she found herself in a war-zone. They observed once how a large group of German soldiers put on French uniforms which they had ready in their kit-bags. Poor Richard L.: 2 years later. The Germans shot his only child, a twenty-one-year-old student, together with other students as hostages because an act of sabotage had taken place and they were suspected of being participants. One refugee after the other gradually returned. They had always attempted to avoid the battle and had brought back sad images of the dead who lay on the road-sides as sombre reminders of their flight. Then came the decrees: that the shop-keepers must immediately raise their shutters and had to open their businesses again; and outwardly, that life took its usual course again, but inside, the businesses changed quickly. At first, the food shops which were over-flowing with goods before the invasion became emptier and emptier. The Germans bought and bought. In the large emporiums, first of all they bought large suitcases and then filled them – more and more German women followed and helped to empty the businesses. And then the “Marche Noir”, the black market began, and with it, for we immigrants and many Belgians who did not have the means to buy on the black market, began the time of hunger. - 6 – The ration cards which we received resulted in such small portions that we lost weight and appeared sad to each other. The material for the bread which the Belgian bakers had to bake they received delivered in a sack. It contained the least amount of meal; “saleté” (rubbish)as a baker answered me when I asked him about the composition of the material delivered for the bread. And then we began to sell our last pieces of jewellery and items of clothing in order to buy decent bread on the black market. Sometimes there was also flour made from chestnuts which you mixed with water and had a period of peace from hunger pangs. The necessary vitamins were missing from our food and everyone’s teeth fell out even relatively young people. I came to Brussels in 1937 with a set of well-maintained teeth. Between 1940 and 1944, they all fell out. I still own a card showing my weight from a pharmacy in Uccle with the weight 79 pounds. My earlier, normal weight had been 104 pounds. Then the first bombs of the English and the Americans fell on the city. For us, there was only an unusable air-raid shelter which had only been half-finished. The only usable one that was available was in the middle of the city of Brussels at the Porte Namur which the Germans had built and ½ an hour away from us. How often did we lie on the ground during an attack to wait for the impending death, when the planes flew very low or if we fled in through the open house doors which we had at our disposal during an air attack. The “Bruesseler Zeitung”, which was produced by the German occupation authorities, was informed by the same dark spirit as “der Stuermer”. This newspaper published the regulation that all Jews had to report to the town hall, in order to receive a yellow star. The star had to be sewn on all items of clothing and be worn so that it was visible. That was in 1942. A year later, the regulation appeared that those Jews who were caught without the star would be taken to the punishment camp “Bredon” near Brussels. At this time, a young Belgian relative of mine (a non-Jew), S.V., who had just past her teaching exams, was accused of working for the underground and with her associates was arrested and taken to the St. Gilles prison in Brussels. She shared the same cell as an English woman and her daughter. The husband of the woman, an English officer, had been sentenced to death. S. was full of admiration for Mrs. M. who bore her fate with dignity. After a year, S. was taken to Holland to work on marshland, and in the end taken to the Ravensbrueck concentration camp, where she remained until she was freed by the Swedish Count Bernadotte. After 3 months of nursing in Sweden, she came back to her mother in Brussels. At the same time, they began to transport all young Belgians of both sexes to Germany for forced labour and there began a hunt for those people who did not comply with the summons to report. - 7 – These people were not safe at any time. They seized them in cafes, restaurants and in front of cinemas. Then there was a hunt in the streets which I observed out of my window. Coming into the city unsuspectingly from outside on bikes, they had to dismount and get into the lorries of the Germans which they kept in side streets. Now, these young people began to hide themselves whilst their older parents continued to work, sleeping on the ground, alternating with friends and using other names because now the conscriptions were sent to their houses. Now it was worst of all for the Jews because during the search for the “avoiders”, they very often found hidden Jews. One of our friends, the Jewish painter K. from Berlin was found and taken in this manner. K. was a good artist, a pupil of Liebermann, who had painted two beautiful portraits of women just before the invasion of Belgium. A good, Catholic priest had kept him hidden for over a year. A police car stopped early in the morning to at my friend L.K. ask her about an ‘avoider’. Believing that she had been discovered, she wanted to execute the plan that was thought out for such cases to go over a glass roof to reach a neighbouring house. But she fell through the greenhouse and suffered bad injuries to her leg. In the meantime, theGestapowent on their way. L. was taken to a private hospital where she stayed for some weeks. The persecution of the Jews became ever more severe. They came around midday into the apartment of my cousin Claire B. They had arrested her son-in-law in a restaurant and had opened the floor doors with his key and called to the mother and daughter to “come with them”. My cousin took poison, but she was dragged away with them and taken to a hospital. The Germans informed the shocked hospital leadership that “this person belongs to us”, and from there, they sent my cousin onwards to Poland. My non-Jewish, Belgian friends visited her in hospital. She never saw her daughter again. She also perished. At this time, a treacherous Jew called “Jack”, who was from Poland, drove through the streets with theGestapoin a police car. As soon as the occupants of the car sensed a Jewish face, the car was stopped, and the suspect had to show his card – false or genuine – in case it established that he was a Jew. If he was a Jew, he had to get into the car to disappear and never be seen again. The first stop on the path to death was the Malines (Mecheln in German) assembly camp in Belgium. The Chief of Police for foreigners at the “Maison Communale” in Uccle, whom I knew personally, told me: “Never remain standing on the street with Jewish friends or acquaintances, because theGestapohas bought around 15-20 street urchins (street youths) for their office. - 8 – These have the task to follow behind the person as well as the persons they were speaking to, in order to watch where they live, and the urchins have to put their addresses in the next post box (to direct the occupation authorities to them.)” Onearrestafter the other followed: the sister-in-law, who had two children, of my acquaintance, Dr. R. from Cassel, was nabbed by Jack whilst crossing the street Chaussée d’Alsemberg in Uccle (this long street was especially favoured by the treacherous “Jack”; 3000 numbers extended from the Porte Hall to the Gare du Midi). She never came back and has disappeared ever since. Many individuals believed that they could save themselves from persecution by entering into a Belgian marriage because the Bruesseler Zeitung untruthfully announced that Belgian Jews would remain untouched. After they believed this to be certain, they brought items and pictures which they had given to their friends for safe keeping back into their apartments, whereupon after a short time over one thousand Belgian Jews were arrested and deported in a single night. Amongst them were 3 young girls, H’s from Antwerp, who worked as secretaries and who supported the household of their old parents. They were fine, intelligent girls whom I met with their friends in Brussels. The apartments of all those arrested were robbed right down to the last basin over the next few days. Large transport columns full of furniture went to Germany. My good friend Bronia P., who was formerly a sociologist in Berlin, had opened a home for children whose parents had in part disappeared. She had a beautiful, old house with a large garden and could arrange it so that the children were marvellously kept and well supplied with clothes and food from all sides. We acted as “aunts” who visited them, often played with them and took them out on certain days so that the children felt they were in a family. I took over two splendid young brothers whom I had taken to heart and who were affectionately attached to me. When our days for a walk came, they were already standing there at the door of the house. Some young people including female students, especially those who liked children, worked in the house. Up to this point in time, theGestapohad always made use of police cars, but one day 2 civilians in a large Belgian car arrived so that no one suspected a calamity, and some of the young helpers who had a small errand in the shops returned peacefully to the house. My friend Bronia was right at the back of the very big garden when she learnt to her horror that her helpers had been taken away. She ran quickly in to the houses of a Belgian neighbours and asked if they would take the children quickly. In this way, she was successful in saving the children. - 9 – In this period, theGestapohad eliminated a home, in Tervuren, Brussels’s garden suburb, in which between 14 to 18 Jewish children had lived in hiding with two Catholic nuns. The took all of the children with them, and as I heard it, they also took the wonderful people who had sacrificed their lives, the two Catholic sisters. Bronia lived in hiding with her son, who was 18 at that time, her mother, and a younger sister Cilia in a 3-storey house. She hurried to her apartment. There was a grocery business on the ground floor of her building where Cilia bought some food. She showed herself alone so that no one would suspect that her mother and nephew lived above. The businessman had often made disparaging remarks about Jews and did not suspect that Cilia was Jewish. Previously, Cilia had been trained and had been employed in Antwerp as an expert in the diamond trade and had repeated offers from a New York firm with a very high salary which she rejected in order not to leave her mother in Belgium. Cilia was a joy to us all. She sang, danced and improvised amusing cabarets. She was a born actress. It was a very hot August day when Cilia in a very thin dress and without stockings went to a shop lying opposite in order to buy something. Suddenly, a car drove up and she had to get into it. We later learnt that she had been betrayed. Their hiding place was the apartment of a sports friend, who had a friend in the sports club who had built up debts through various deceptions. This friend, whom Cilia’s friend only learnt of his dishonesty herself later, earned the money that the Germans paid for a betrayal. On that evening, Bronia, her mother and Marc her son, came to me because they knew that they were no longer safe and asked me to take them. Our good friend Anny was already with me. Anny, a non-Jew and a viola player with the Orchestre National, Radio Bruxelles, who now lives in London. You know her as your “aunt Anny”. She was married to the Jewish musical director, B., who was a Polish national. We thought things over: Bronia could sleep upstairs with her mother in my large attic. The Belgian ladies, who lived in the apartment below were thoroughly decent and fine people and wanted to give us bedclothes; and Marc would have to share a room with Anny’s husband. At that time, we considered Anny’s husband as safe because as a Pole he did not have to be entered into the German Jewish register. After 4 days, Anny received a postcard from Malines (the assembly camp for the deportation to Poland) from Cilia asking Anny to advise Cilia’s mother that she was in Malines. Anny said: “Now they have my address; now my husband is lost and also Marc, Bronia’s son.” We decided that Marc should now also live above with me. - 10 – Anny wanted to hide her husband temporarily in Laaken near Brussels. A short time before, I had undergone a sham marriage in the belief I could protect myself by taking another name. Belgian friends had transferred a small sum of money for welfare purposes to the Catholic-French hospital. The man, an invalid and a naturalised Belgian of French birth, was in this hospital. However, shortly afterwards, came the German decree that marriages of German women with Belgians concluded after 1942 would not be recognised. On the advice of Mr. De R., I rented a room in some area of Uccle and paid the rent a month in advance. I had myself registered at the address of this room in the Maison Communale. Then I was to go to a different apartment, my present one, which I should not report to the Maison Communale. We lived harmoniously together in my unregistered apartment. I made my small purchases in the neighbourhood, whilst Anny, if she went into the city on her bicycle or to the Radio Symphony Orchestra, brought back food or vegetables, or the Belgian ladies in our house did the purchases, so that it would not be apparent in the businesses opposite that I bought very large amounts of groceries. My apartment was located opposite a rather large garden surrounding the “Assistance Publique”. In the mornings, there was actually always a large crush on the part of the unemployed, the “chaumeurs”, who received assistance there. In the evenings after 6 PM, the building was completely closed and lay in darkness. I knew this building very well from inside because the first time I myself was unemployed, I obtained my “wage” every week as a “chaumeur”. The Belgian government had announced that that everyone completely without means of support and without work had the right of assistance from the Belgian state.  One day, an employee said to me in a friendly, but sad tone: “We have received an instruction from the Germans that we must position the Jewish recipients separately from the other recipients.” For some time, I had taught glove-making and through that earned some money, but now I decided immediately not to go anymore to the Assistance Publique because, naturally, I would have been putting myself in great danger if I lined up with the other Jews and not with the needy non-Jews. As a result of the fact that the building opposite us could not directly observe us and the fact that the ladies of our house permitted the front door to stay open even at night, Marc, who worked in the underground movement, was able to - 11 – come home often very late at night. We were always all very happy when we heard him come in – and did not ask of course if we heard explosions often. Sometimes on Sundays some young men came to him in the attic. One after the other came; and one after the other left, unnoticed. The Symphony Orchestra of the BBC in Brussels ceased. The director H. had no desire to play for the Germans and withdrew into private life with music lessons. As a result, Anny was without work and earnings. However, Queen Elizabeth, who herself was a practising violinist, organised private concerts with trios or quartets etc., twice a week in her castle in Laaken near Brussels. Luckily, Anny was called in. According to the German regulation, Jews had to give up their radios and there were penalties for Belgians who listened to English programmes. I listened with my Belgian friends to Churchill speaking after a friendly watchman had been posted outside. We became accustomed to understanding everything despite the strong interference which the Germans made. It was a bleak day when Churchill said: „I have nothing to offer you but blood and tears.” And in this way our mood changed according to every sort of rumour until gradually through the radio and illegal presses we learned that the position of the Allies had improved and the we were near to liberation. Secretly printed newspapers informed us about much that was happening, amongst which was “le libre Belge” which was banned by the Germans. The son of my friend H’s with whom I had lived at the time of my escape from Germany, prepared leaflets in the cellar of the house with his friend, who we called Herman, an alias. They were both discovered shortly before the liberation and taken to Auschwitz where the son of H was liberated. Herman did not return. H’s son came back after a long spell in a typhus camp. Around the time when the forbidden leaflets appeared, there was suddenly in many places where posters were put up large letters in white chalk reading: R.A.V. I enquired from the Belgians what the letters meant and learnt that they meant - Royal Airforce Vainquera (Royal Airforce will win). Then the same letters appeared in chalk on some house walls. A regulation came out to the effect that the owner on whose house these letters appeared and who did not immediately have them washed them off, would be severely punished. From this moment on, there were hardly any houses in the entire city which did not boast these letters. Against this, the Germans were powerless. They could not lock up everybody. What did the Germans do? They painted every car and every other vehicle in a similar way: R.A.V. - 12 – We learnt constantly that “the position of the Allies was improving all the time”. Now as dusk approached we observed the evening sky and waited for the liberating aeroplanes. “Today it is so clear – they will come today.” We were hopeful every evening – “Tonight?” Then – one morning around 8 A.M. – the youth from the baker shop knocked on the window pane on the ground floor kitchen of the ladies. One word: “Debarques!” (Which means – disembarked.) We went outside. Everyone came out – at a stroke it was very lively in the street. Each person looked at the others with a happy and meaningful facial expression. I got on a tram to travel into the city. It was the same mood on the tram. Everyone looked at each other meaningfully and smiled. It was not so with the Germans soldiers who stood on the platform. They looked very serious. Now unlikely sounding rumours emerged: “Montgomery - Monty” – as he was affectionately known, with a huge bridge on which were a few soldiers, landed on the coast, surprised the Germans who believed that the entire Allied army had landed, and took the whole army prisoner. I had a good acquaintance, Berta K. who was formerly from Darmstadt. She had been very well accommodated in Brussels by my Belgian friends in the family of an acquaintance of mine, the Belgian painter W. She was there for over a year. At B’s request, they dismissed their cleaning lady so that there was no threat of betrayal. The three sons helped with the work of washing and cleaning. It was performed on Sundays. Now, unfortunately, the lady of the house was mentally ill. Her husband and sons did not want to put her in an institution because they considered their mother harmless. She sometimes cut up tablecloths or bed linen, apart from that she did not do upsetting things and treated B. in a friendly manner. However, one day Madam W., the lady of the house, who had perhaps read something political, went to the Belgian police and denounced B. as a foreigner. They had nothing to say because the Belgian police often helped the Jews to procure reliable hiding places. The Belgian police informed B. of the complaint. But B. had received such a shock about the possibility that the German police could learn something that she, despite advice to the contrary, quickly left the house. In the past, she had heard of a Dutch woman, who had hidden some Jews and went to her. After the liberation, we learnt that this woman had betrayed all the Jews who had lived with her. B. committed the indiscretion of having her post from her friends and acquaintances sent to my address and she fetched it from me. - 13 – As a result, Bronia said to her one day: “You must not do that. You are endangering us, and we are 4 people”, by that she meant that my Belgian name protected us. However, the warning came too late. On a summer night at the beginning of June, I was awakened at 3 AM in the morning by a vigorous ringing and a very loud banging on the house door which the ladies below did not want to open. I looked out of the window onto the street and in front of our door stood a military car. Two soldiers had gotten out and stood at the front door. I then heard the ladies give my name and climbed the stairs to me. Bronia, upstairs, had heard the car, helped her son to climb through the roof window and onto the roof and closed the window, to await her fate with her mother. Two people in uniform, a middle-aged officer and a younger person around 20 came to me. The older man demanded my identity card. “You are a Jew” he said, “then I must take you with me.” I had given him my German card inscribed with red stripes and containing the names “Jew and Sarah”, whilst my false identity card with another name and a street with a house-number that did not exist lay hidden in my bedroom. The false identity card, which they had furnished me with out of friendship, on the advice of M. De R. should only be carried with me on the streets. The identity card issued by the German occupation authorities should always lie in my apartment on the desk. From the statement of the officer: “You are a Jew” I deduced immediately that he had discovered my address with B.K. and was here for a house search for writings or to gather intelligence. And now began a search in the desk, then he checked all my books, which he looked at page by page. I did not have any kind of address apart from harmless city addresses. I had my foreign addresses in my head, and likewise the addresses of all my friends in the city. This search of the books lasted around an hour. I went into my bedroom to dress. I was so confused because I knew my false identity card was there under my items in my bedroom, that I made no attempt to put on my clothes and only continually tested which heavy shoes to choose. The soldier who followed into the bedroom said from time to time: “get a move on, get a move on!”. In the end, I put on a warm coat over my night shirt and my thick shoes and went into the room until the officer who was checking my printed material and writing things was finished. He went into the hall, looked around, went to the stairs which led to the upper rooms and ground-floor rooms, put one foot on the stairs and asked: “Where is your husband?” - 14 – At that moment, one idea went through my head: „Prevent him from going upstairs and finding the other three.” I walked quickly down the stairs in front of him and said: “My husband is in hospital” and both men followed me down the stairs. Bronia told me later that when they heard them speaking about the upstairs, they believed that they were lost. The Belgian women had been requested long before this took place, to inform my Belgian friends, whose addresses I had given to the ladies, if anything happened to me. Now I sat in the car with the two military men. Both were never impolite to me. On the contrary: I had the impression that it was not pleasant for the older officer when he saw my identity card with the Jewish stamp and that he had toarrestme because he had to carry out the order given to him. We drove into the night and I asked the younger soldier: “Where am I being taken?” but received no answer. Soon I learnt it, when we stopped in front of a building and I was passed over to a soldier. This man opened a cellar room which lead to a bigger room and told me to go in. Now I knew where I was. In the room, which was in the cellar of theGestapobuilding, there were between 15-20 people on wooden benches. On a white wall written in black chalk was: “Goodbye to life”. There were no covers. The fates and perspectives of some of those arrested made me despondent. For example, there were two very young married couples there who explained to me that they had been seized although it had been confirmed to them by an uncle in Switzerland that they had the right to go to Palestine in an exchange for prisoners. One of the young women had been terribly beaten up during thearrest. One eye, from which blood seeped out, appeared to be lost. She and her husband had hidden themselves in a coal cellar when they saw theGestapocar stop before their door. Each had a different fate; most were German, and most were very young German couples. The next morning around 1 PM, my name was called out. I was informed that I would be taken to the internment camp in Anderlecht. I was accommodated in a room with 76 people of both sexes with whom I shared several months together until the liberation by the English and the Americans. They had chosen a middle-aged man as the barracks senior who luckily believed in order and cleanliness. Everyone had to wipe clean their place in the camp daily. - 15 – In addition, it was prescribed that the skylights had always to stay open. However, as a result of the fact that the outer doors to the toilets always had to stay open at night and there was a constant draught, I immediately picked up the flu with a fever. Not far from my camp, a Belgian man who had been lame since childhood, and who had moved from Berlin to Brussels in 1933 with his German wife, was accommodated. His much younger wife looked after me. I often felt during the nights how a friendly being bent over me and laid a cold compress on my brow. Later we became good friends and she told me her story. Her husband had been a secretary and interpreter with the Turkish embassy in Berlin. His wife had taken an exam for a diploma in English and Italian when they became acquainted. Mr. C. had believed he could save his wife and himself in Brussels if they married and moved there. They were arrested in their apartment, and similarly, and in the interim, taken to Anderlecht. I heard that the inmates of the home in Anderlecht, mainly older people, totalled several thousand. We had to alternate working in the kitchen, that meant under the direction of a woman peeling potatoes or carrying out various other works. Sufficient food was delivered by the Belgian authorities. We had received white cards from theGestapowhich we had to carry with us if we went outside the home which we were permitted to do during certain hours. As I learnt, the internment house had been established by Queen Elizabeth with great difficulty, in order to save older people. Suddenly one night, many of us woke up because bright rays of light fell into our bedrooms. Those who woke up went to the window and saw that outside in the large courtyards, which in part were grassy areas and earthen paths, large lorries were lined up. It was said on all sides the next morning that our situation had become very serious. They wanted to send us all to Poland. There was great disquiet in our room. It was said that “Queen Elizabeth, the Belgian Queen, had repeatedly intervened with the German general von Falkenhausen, in order to prevent the deportation.”  I had seen the queen once from a distance when she came out of another hall. That meant that she had old friends here to whom she had brought flowers. It was then explained that the German position was so bad that they might have to retreat. You could hear the thunder of artillery from the front more and more clearly. Then a day came when the greatest consternation prevailed in the hall. It was said that the situation was very bad for us and if the Queen did not succeed in preventing it - 16 – We would have to leave in 2 days – when some, who still had their suitcases with them when they arrived, wanted to unpack their things, someone called out: “Do you believe that there will be an extra attachment on the lorry for your leather suitcase?” There were sad scenes. Some women wept and held their heads in their hands. Lucie C. came to me: “I am not going with it; I’m not going with it; I will hide myself outside tonight and then take off.” I had again a feverish cold and I was so light-headed that I did not perceive everything clearly. I saw everything as through a veil. That same night the noise from the artillery was such, as if it was coming from very near. When morning dawned, there was suddenly a terrible noise and clamour in the main streets close to where we were located. The doors were torn open and people rushed in shouting: “The Germans are coming through here. They are retreating, but they are still shooting into the people who line up on the sides. They hit and killed a 17-year-old girl in Uccle. “ Then our hall senior came and said: “All the Belgians are raising the Belgian flags; the war is finished. You can all do what you want. You do not need the white cards anymore if you go out of the house.” We walked along the main street of Anderlecht. The jubilation and joyful dancing of the population are indescribable. We were drawn by the people into the crowd to take part in the delight. Some people cut the yellow star from our arms with their pocket knives. And then the first Germans arrived, but they were in complete contrast as to when I saw them on the morning 4 ½ years ago when they arrived. They dragged themselves laboriously forwards; pulling horses with wounded hooves behind them. It was a sorry column. The soldiers were covered in mud; their faces pale and they were dog-tired. I thought: “You are all victims; you had to go to war perhaps with feelings of hate for your butchers. Some of you will also have suffered a lot.” (It had been said in Brussels a year before that many soldiers had abandoned Hitler, but that they were spied upon and some had even committed suicide.) Then I went into the centre of Brussels to the square in front of the stock exchange. There I met the first English and American soldiers. It was all like a dream. Young girls and young women fell around the necks of the astonished English and Americans and kissed them. Those that could climbed on their lorries and simply drove with them. - 17 – Alas, so many of these, flourishing young people, who came first, soon fell at the bridges over the Rhine where soon the battle raged. The entire city was on the streets. The big stone steps in front of the Stock Exchange was densely occupied from top to bottom by people. Businesses had all closed for 8 days. A poster said: “So that the personnel can witness the celebration of the liberation.” In the side streets of the Stock Exchange and on the large boulevards, the crashing and booming of furniture and other items which the Belgians threw through the window onto the street could be heard. It was the furniture and other belongings of those Belgians who had worked with the Germans against their own people. In a lot of cases, it concerned Belgian publishers of German friendly newspapers. Also, the press building where I had recently read on a large poster: “Mortal danger sweeps over England.” In some houses, blood was spilt – there Belgians struck their treacherous fellow citizens. The celebration of liberation lasted 8 days. When I returned again to my apartment, the Belgian women who lived there to me in their arms. Then I climbed the stairs to my floor. The lock, which led to my rooms, was blocked. A neighbour helped to open it. I opened the door and went into the kitchen to make a cup of coffee. What a sight! Millions of flies swirled around; the remains of our evening meal for 4 people had stood there for months. My counterfeit identity card, which I had thought about anxiously so often, was still in the bedroom. “If they searched the apartment thoroughly and found the card, then I would have been lost.” I went into my bedroom which led behind to a small garden. The air was so clear and pure and there was not a cloud in the sky. At this point a feeling of salvation and liberation came over me. Now to be allowed to breathe in peace with the prospect of being able to see my children again in the foreseeable future. From Marianne, your mother, I had received a letter from England shortly before the outbreak of the war. In this, she wrote to me that she was in love with a man and believed that he also loved her. Then a ½ a year later, I received a postcard from Switzerland from my sister in French and using another name. However, I knew her writing. She said:” that Marianne had got engaged to the man with whom she is very much in love and will marry soon.” - 18 – It was the man whom she had written to me about whom she loved. Now, because the first English and Americans came into the city, and brought news of relatives, I got into a heightened suspense. I hoped every moment that an Englishman would come and bring me news. Then, there was a ringing at the front door and I heard someone asking for me. I flew down the stairs and saw an English uniform. It was a friend and colleague of your father from the same hospital who brought me the first greetings. He said: “I am a friend of Joe and Marianne. Marianne is expecting her first baby soon”, - that was you Oliver!  And now a brisk letter exchange via Dr. H. who worked as a doctor in a British General Hospital – Liberation on the border. He often came with food packets, vitamins and cigarettes and then the excellent news that Marianne had given birth to a son and that everything had went well. Then also came the news via Marianne from uncle Erhart that he was healthy and living in La Paz, Bolivia. It was a harsh, cold winter. When Dr. H. came, he looked blue with cold. The window panes in my room were covered from top to bottom with thick frost which certainly did not want to thaw. We stood or sat close to my small oven in which a small fire burnt. The means of heating was a type of coal dust which my friend Anny brought in bags if she was able to find such stuff. After the war finished, the survivors of the concentration camps met again little by little in Brussels if they had previously lived there. Almost all had previously spent several months in a hospital to become again halfway normal people so far as that was possible. Brussels made a large hotel(including meals) available in Tervuren, a wooded suburb of Brussels, and a hotel with a large garden in Laaken where the royal palace was located for those who had returned to Brussels. We others, who did not actually come from concentration camps, and other refugees who had been able to successfully hide themselves from the Germans till the end of the war, tried to acquire clothing and other necessities for those who had returned from the real concentration camps. I went to my former clients, and to all friends and acquaintances and received so much that we were able to bring arms full of clothes daily. My cousin, Hella C. gave everything she could do without. She was so delighted to have her daughter back again with her from Ravensbrück after she was liberated. (Today, Simone is the professor of mathematics at her school.) How much humiliation and misery had all of these people suffered! - 19 – A young 21 year-old woman, who had lain in the experimentalblockin Auschwitz where blood was taken from her daily which was definitely destined for wounded German soldiers, went around on crutches because she was so weak even though she had had 3 months of hospital care behind her. We heard so much that was horrific about what happened inDachauand Auschwitz, that we requested no more explanations because many of the relatives of the people who had not come back again, came, in order to ask questions. Now we did everything possible to create a benign, serene atmosphere. My old, spirited cousin S.S. read her humorous poems during coffee and cakes! Many who were talented actors and actresses attempted to create hours of forgetfulness for the poor people. We often made small walks to the area surrounding the hotel through beautiful, old beech woods with large bushes of colourful rhododendron. I still want to mention: after the English and Americans had liberated us, rockets called V.1. were fired at us at that time by the Germans from Holland and the unoccupied areas of Germany which had a terrible effect. I can no longer remember the date. Almost all these V.1.’s fell on the Uccle part of the city. They hit a large hospital in Avenue Brugmann not far from our house on the day after a group of Jewish children from Liege had found refuge there. All the children as well as the doctors and nurses were killed. Only a heap of rubble remained from the large building. In our house, which shook from the blast, plaster fell from the ceiling and the walls. The window panes broke. Another V.1. bomb fell again 2 days later close to our house and destroyed several houses in our neighbourhood. The day after that American soldiers were clearing up and were killed under a wall that collapsed. I stood at night at the open window. It was bright, and I think there was moon light. I looked to the heavens and saw a long aeroplane gliding along, which looked like a huge silver cigar. At the point and at the back there was a bright green light. “Oh God,” I thought. “That is going to England.” It was close to Christmas, and we heard with dreadful fear that the Germans were again close, around 30 km. from Brussels. They had wreaked havoc in the Ardennes and had undertaken a punishment action against a village. Only a few inhabitants survived. The reason was that they had found their opponents in their former admistrative roles. - 20 – However, this time our fate had determined to be merciful to us. The great danger passed; the Allies beat the Germans again. Our life took it normal course again. We now had ration cards which fed us adequately. And before I close I want to mention that I spend my birthday in Brussels with my dear friends. First of all, a telegram came from Marianne, your mother, and at the same time the international flower organisation brought me a beautiful bunch of roses. And in the afternoon, our friend the Belgian portrait painter Henry L. came with a water-colour of our former country house in the German mountains. He executed the water-colour on the basis of a sketch which he had made there. The good Bronia E. again established a home for Jewish children who had become orphans. My friend Kaete R., who had looked after me for some time whilst I had the flu, came. She had had some frightful days behind her when she had been in the Malines assembly camp where she was able to save friends. Actually, as a former radiologist, she was taken in to the Jewish hospital as a nurse. Anny C. who made apple tarts came. We now had fine, American powered-egg. My cousin Hella V.C., who was very happy, came with her daughter Simone who was liberated from Ravensbrück. Simmi K., who was again healthy after his fall through the glass roof and Berta K., who was liberated by the Russians after she had survived Auschwitz.We were all alive, all who sat here together, but each of us thought about our relatives and friends who had been torn from life. They had all been worthwhile people.And then 6 months later a telegram came from England “visa granted”. And then your good father, Marianne’s husband, came and fetched me from Brussels to take me to England. In the beautiful England I have found a second homeland. I also have loving friends here. And the sea which I love very much is within reach. It is only 25 minutes by the bus from house to the sea-shore. I am grateful that fate has granted me some time to be able to follow your development into a capable person. I close this report in the firm hope and confidence that this will be the last war.

      "My “Underground” Life in Berlin My first personal contact with Hitler’s reign of terror came in1938 after the assassination in Paris. At that time my husband and I were living in a pretty villa at 18, Wolfgraben in Eschwege an der Werra. My husband owned a factory producing shop fittings for butchers’ shops, however by then had already had to close his business because as a Jew he was no longer allowed to work in the food sector. After “reprisals” had already been threatened on the radio and Jews were beaten and their homes destroyed in the neighbouring small town of Spangenberg, I suddenly heard on that November night the rattle of windowpanes in our porch, which led onto the garden. We had locked ourselves in, but the door to our bedroom was broken down and six men stormed in. They were not residents of Eschwege, but men from the surrounding area. They did not wear a uniform and looked wild and unkempt. On the command of one of them, “One, two, three,” they began systematically to destroy every piece of furniture in the room. I began to scream wildly and one of the men, a boy of about 16 years old, came up to me and said, “Good lady, do not scream so much. This is only because of the murder in Paris!” I said to him in reply, “Boy, if someone treated your mother this badly, what would you have to say then?” This, as it later turned out, did not fail to hit the target. All the time my husband sat on the edge of the bed as if turned to stone. After everything in the bedroom had been destroyed, the men stormed into the drawing room and with their bayonets ripped the brocade furniture covers and tore out all the upholstery, all of the glass and china was smashed and even the flowers and cacti in the window designed for keeping and displaying flowers did not escape the vandalism. After even the entrance hall with its beautiful grandfather clock and lacquered furniture had been brutally and senselessly destroyed, one of the fellows came back into our room and went up to my husband with his bayonet and cried, “So, Jew, now I’ll deal with you.” I threw myself onto this man to prevent the worst happening and at that moment the boy, to whom I had earlier spoken so fearlessly, intervened and said, “Leave them in peace now!” The gang then took their rage out on the kitchen, where - 2 - simply everything was smashed and only a high mountain of broken shards and debris remained when they finally cleared off. I fell into a dead faint, and as there were no longer any Jewish doctors in the town my husband went to get a Nazi doctor. He came immediately and said, “We don’t agree with all this, but we have to go along with it.” As it soon turned out, I had almost lost my sight because of the turmoil and the demented screaming. The next morning a friend telephoned and reported that her husband had been taken away. My husband immediately packed a small case and took a roundabout route to the station, to go to Berlin. I was still hoping that he had got away safely when a policeman (Wiegand) came who we knew to be a fit and proper person and who was very favourably disposed towards my husband. With a very sad face he handed my husband’s little suitcase over to me and said, “Frau Gassenheimer, I have your husband’s things here for you. They have caught him too.” Later my husband told me that he had been taken with other Jews to the so-called “castle” in Eschwege and had had to spend a few days there in the most humiliating conditions waiting for a transport. During this time, the town’s swimming teacher (whose daughter had been my husband’s secretary) had behaved particularly badly. When each morning at 5 o’clock the men would have to fall in for roll call, knee deep in mire, he stood there with a whip and laid into the Jews, cursing them with the most offensive language and spitting at them. I only found out what had become of my husband after two weeks of unspeakable worry. What happened was that I then received a pre-printed postcard fromBuchenwaldasking me to send a change of clothes and 20 marks, which they had to pay as the price of their “stay”. In the meantime I waited in our ruined home for my husband to return. As all the electric light bulbs had been smashed I was at first in darkness, however then a man came secretly in the evenings who at least got the electric light working again. After exactly four weeks my husband returned, dreadfully ill. We tried to escape somewhere abroad but did not manage to do so, and therefore we continued to stagnate in Eschwege. In April 1939 we were told that we would have to leave our house within four weeks. It had been sold over our heads to the mayor, who then even moved into it. We were unable to find accommodation in Berlin so quickly, and as nobody in Eschwege was allowed - 3 - to take in Jews any longer a Jewish master baker eventually offered us a place to stay. There were no facilities for cooking there though, and another Jewish family used to give us meals. We lived like this for four weeks, until in June 1939 we were able to move to Berlin. We were then able to live for about a year in Berlin without anyone bothering us, where our existence was quite bearable in comparison to the complete isolation and the constant abuse in Eschwege. My daughter, who was married to a doctor, was also living in Berlin at that time. My son-in-law had already emigrated to England, but the visa for my daughter only arrived in Germany after the outbreak of war, and so she had to work as a factory hand at Siemens. The experiences of my daughter at this time and her escape have been recorded in the book “Escape from Berlin” by Catherine Klein, published by Gollancz. All the turmoil, and above all the screaming, on the night of the raid had badly damaged my eyes and in January 1940 I suddenly started getting the kind of headaches that made the doctor who called round order me to be taken immediately to the Jewish Hospital, and my eyes were operated on that very same day. Conditions in the Jewish Hospital at that time were such that I was able to have my own day and night nurse, and the care at that time was even quite good still. Even after my return to our small apartment my husband still managed to get hold of some kinds of food for us, which were not officially available to Jews. So for example in a shop in Hohenstauffen Strasse in Schöneberg he would sometimes be given coffee, the sale of which had already been forbidden to us Jews, with the “J” on our ration cards, for a long time. However somebody informed on us, and every Jew who had to some extent been treated humanely there had to pay a fine of 50 marks. Also my husband, who did not look Jewish, sometimes offered his services to unload fruit and instead of being paid got a couple of pounds of cherries or something of the sort, as we Jews were not allowed to buy any fruit. He also helped in the market on the fish stalls and in this way from time to time managed to get us some fresh fish, which was not distributed to Jews either. After the operation I had to have complete quiet and was not even allowed to do my little bit of housework. But at that time it was still possible to engage an elderly Jewish spinster for the housework. - 4 - However my husband’s health had been completely ruined during his imprisonment inBuchenwald, and he was unable to recover from it. His heart became weaker and weaker, and after several heart attacks he succumbed to just such an attack on July 8th 1941. In the meantime we Jews had been ever more herded together in our homes. We already shared our 4-roomed apartment with another married couple and even on the day after my husband’s death a Jewish gentleman appeared at my door and asked me, in a very abrupt manner, to clear out the bedroom which I had shared with my husband as I was now only entitled to one room. As my appeal to his humanity, and furthermore my position as a Jewish fellow sufferer, made no impression on him at all, I went to the Jewish accommodation office in order to ask for a few days grace for clearing out the room. There I found in Herr Rudolf Schwarz, the well-known conductor, an extremely understanding person, who helped me to keep the small apartment for a while longer. I lived like this at 60, Günzel Strasse until January 1942. Like all other Jewish homes the door bore the big Jewish star. Through the upheaval associated with my daughter’s escape and all the crying over my dead husband my eyes had become so bad again that I had to undergo a second eye operation. Once again I placed myself in the care of the good Dr Hirschfeld in the Jewish Hospital, who later looked after me in the most wonderful way. Conditions in the Jewish Hospital had greatly deteriorated since my last operation. There were no more single rooms; four female patients lay in one small ward, which was never heated. The food was in very short supply and barely edible. After the operation I returned to my apartment in Günzel Strasse. Shortly afterwards the husband of Frau Wind, who lived with me, died and the room which had been allocated to him was likewise immediately given to somebody else. An 83-year-old woman then moved into the apartment with her two grown up daughters. A small back room, which had no proper access, was allotted to me, so that I always had to go through the room of the old lady and her two daughters. Soon after my return from the hospital they took Frau Wind away. As was usual at that time, Jewish men used to carry out this task to try to avoid any fuss. They wore armbands, which marked them out as officials in order to protect themselves from being arrested. They came on foot and accompanied Frau Wind to a meeting point in the neighbourhood from where she would be deported “to the east”. - 5 - In due course I witnessed many such deportations. So I still remember well how my sister-in-law, my husband’s sister, was taken away. She had already been notified about a year earlier when she had been sent the so-called “lists”, an inventory of all the items that people were allowed to take with them. All these things, which would supposedly then be placed at the disposal of the person concerned in Theresienstadt or similar camps, were never actually handed over to the victims. My sister-in-law had been told at that time that she would be allowed to stay in Berlin for a while longer if she placed certain funds at the disposal “of Theresienstadt”. I no longer remember how much money was involved, but I do know that she handed over a considerable sum in order to buy herself a few more months of relative freedom in Berlin. But then she too was taken away by the Jewish collaborators. Then elderly 83-year-old Frau Süssmann died. Her case was very similar, as they took away the daughter who had had to look after her because she was now “useless”. The two daughters clung together quite particularly and so the other sister, who had been made to work at Siemens, freely offered to share her sister’s fate. In fact because of their pleading she was allowed to go down part of the way with her sister, but then they sent her back because she was still capable of work. She then went into hiding in Charlottenburg with her married sister whose husband was anAryan. However one Sunday morning very soon afterwards, two men stood outside the door and wanted to take Fräulein Süssmann away. When I told them that I did not know where she was, they adopted a very threatening attitude. One of them sat down on a seat in front of my door and said he would not go away again until I had brought Fräulein Süssmann out, or else he would take me away instead of her. He was even a young Jewish man! I rang her up and put the difficult choice to her. She immediately declared that she was prepared to come, but on the way, in her great distress, she had an accident jumping off the tram and was taken to the Jewish Hospital with concussion after a Christian hospital had refused to admit her. But even her accident did not save her. She was taken from the Jewish Hospital and also sent “to the east”. I then stayed alone in the apartment, the only Jew in the building. The other rooms were sealed up. Like all Jews at this time who still had cash at their disposal, I was allowed to withdraw 200 marks per month from my blocked account. The bank manager, a Herr Spangenberg, - 6 - had always been particularly friendly and helpful towards me. He had even offered to help me escape to Switzerland, but the plan proved to be unviable, the man behind it a conman and I lost a large sum of money through it. When he saw me coming Herr Spangenberg said, quite shocked, “Frau Gassenheimer! Are you still here? I was told that by March 5th there would be no Jews left in Berlin.” It was March 2nd - I was still going to fetch my money at the beginning of each month. Although of course I had not known of this date, I was prepared to be taken away. I had shared out certain items of value among all my friends. I had sewn some money that I had partly saved and partly acquired through the sale of pieces of furniture into articles of clothing which I wanted, and was permitted, to take with me, and I had also packed a rucksack with things to eat – for the long journey. In those days the air raids on Berlin were particularly bad. Our whole quarter, all round the Prager Platz, was an inferno. Like all Jews, I had at my disposal a “Jewish” air raid shelter, but the night after the bank manager’s revelation I did not go down but spent it alone in my apartment. The next morning I had to go to the chemist to fetch my eye drops. The concierge, a Frau Keckert, a bad sort and a party member, stopped me and asked where I was going. When I replied, “Am I no longer allowed to go out then?” she said, “In your place I would not leave.” I knew that I could not trust her. But she had promised my husband to help me, if ever it were necessary. In order to get her on my side I had promised a short while earlier to give her my particularly nice kitchen equipment, which she had immediately taken down in the lift with her even worse husband. I had already heard her boasting that she could provide for seven daughters from the “inherited” property of Jews who had been arrested, and when I later came back into the building after the years I had spent living illegally, she still had a whole warehouse in the cellar area. Regardless of this woman’s warning I therefore left the building and went to friends, the Katzmann family, who lived in the same street, Günzel Strasse, at number 45. Herr Katzmann was Jewish, she was anAryanwho supported herself and her husband by making hats. They had proved to be good friends during these difficult times. Frau Katzmann, as anAryan, was able to obtain many kinds of food for me, which Jews were no longer able to get hold of at all. For example I remember a pound of chocolate which she once got for me. It cost 40 marks though, but in my state of complete starvation I readily gave her the money that I had obtained from the sale of articles of clothing etc, which had become worthless to me. As ever, - 7 - the Katzmanns received me in a very friendly way and arranged that I should not go home, but share a watery potato soup with them. A heavy feeling of dread lay on us all. Herr Katzmann said to me that he would not let the worst happen and showed me a small locket that he carried on his watch chain and which contained poison. An inner unease prevented me from staying there for long, and when I eventually left the house I saw standing directly opposite the vehicle which took the last Jews away from Berlin. This was it, a high military truck that had already become known to us, into which the victims could only climb with great difficulty. Then with my own eyes I saw them being driven in with whips. Eventually I got a grip of myself and went into my own house. The concierge came up to me and said,” They wanted to take you away but I just said to them that you were too respectable to run away.” My apartment was sealed, my carefully assembled last possessions inaccessible. I had also left just a small suitcase containing some worthless things down with the concierge which she then handed over to me. On that day I was wearing, as always of late, three dresses on top of each other, but in my agitation I had grabbed a pair of very laddered stockings. The concierge then gave me a pair of her own stockings although these were not much better than my own. She then said to me that the men had left behind instructions that I should go to the synagogue in Levetzow Strasse, from where a group transport would leave. However I did not go to Levetzow Strasse. First of all I went back to the Katzmanns again. By this time Herr Katzmann had taken the poison and lay dying. I could hear his rasping breaths. So I could not stay there. I had also left a case with some things with Frau Katzmann which she now also loyally handed back to me as I had risked my life to go back to fetch it. However she did then ask me not to put her in danger by further visits. As it later turned out, Herr Katzmann’s self-sacrifice may not have been necessary. The Jewish husbands ofAryanwives were all taken to a meeting point in Berlin, and theAryanwives gathered in front of it and the ensuing scenes resulted in those diplomats still resident in Berlin supporting them and successfully having the men set free. These women were then all conscripted to hard labour on building sites. In my despair I then went to a Frau Marga Opiora, who, as she was already elderly, had been able to work at my daughter’s as a serving maid. Before she fled my daughter had already given her an unbelievable number of things, and after she fled she had made a lot of money out of everything that had been left behind which she declared to be “abandoned goods”. I asked her to give me shelter as she had had so much from us. - 8 - She had also promised Dr Hirschfeld that she would help me in an emergency. She said she would have to wait until her husband came home. When her husband came, a brutal fellow who had already been in prison, he planted himself in front of me and said, “Nah, I won’t keep her. They didn’t give me 500 marks a while ago when I needed it to get out of prison.” All my pleading did no good. I asked to be allowed to sleep on the kitchen floor but they stood firm. As I had not eaten all day and was in a miserable state they did at least give me something hot to eat (hash made with calf’s lights) and wanted to send me away immediately, when in came a Fräulein Hensel who had worked as a doctor’s receptionist for my son-in-law and who knew Frau Opiora from there. This Elli became my guardian angel. When she heard my story she invited me to go with her. At that time she lived at the rear of 11, Königgrätzer Strasse. Her friend lived there with her, a Russo-German man who had a serious stomach disorder and who at the time was in a convalescent home. She took me with her and gave me her friend’s room. Without her I would have had no choice but to go to Levetzow Strasse. Elli told me though that I would only be able to lodge with her for a short time and would have to look around for permanent accommodation. Her concierge was a staunch Nazi and posed too big a danger to me. In my great distress I went to Dr Hirschfeld in the Jewish Hospital. We thought that first of all I would have to have papers to get a room at all. He had the address and personal details of twoAryanwomen of whom one, the elder, lay dying. He advised me to write to the place of birth of this woman to say that I had been bombed out and that all my documents had been burned and to ask for copies. The woman in question was Frau Landgraf from Pomerania whose father was a carpenter. About ten days later when I then held the copies in my hand, I became Frau Anna Landgraf,Aryan. And took the Jewish star off my clothes. With this, my time of living illegally underground began. However first of all I had to live through about four weeks of constant wandering around, searching for a room, which were the worst of my life. Without food (I did not have any food ration cards), without a roof over my head, my life constantly in danger. - 9 - I had got the address of an accommodation service in Friedrich Strasse from Dr Hirschfeld. At that time rooms were difficult to get because of the extensive devastation caused by the bombing and the evacuation of large sections of the population; in addition everyone was distrustful and suspicious of strangers – snooping - and crime boomed at this time. I also had to be particularly careful to avoid if possible families with men or children who were ordered by the Party to spy on the personal circumstances of others. Mostly I travelled to the Berlin suburbs where the destruction was not so great and people were not so jittery, and despite being hindered by my poor sight I usually waited until the evening so that I would not stand out or be recognised as a Jew. Despite this of course I would ring at floors where men in SA uniform opened the door, or where I could tell immediately that they were committed Nazis. It is true that I always escaped with a quickly thought out excuse, however through this constant lack of success became naturally more and more frightened and disheartened. Then I remembered a Frau Alexandra Klose in Buckow-Ost, anAryan, who had visited a fellow patient in my ward at the Jewish Hospital and who had also been very humane and helpful towards me and had slipped me some food. I hoped that perhaps she would take me in for a couple of nights, which despite the great danger associated with this she did. She sent me to friends at Hallesches Tor, a married couple called Kiewe, a Jewish-Aryancouple, who also took me in with them for 8 days. They had a single son who at that time had been called-up, despite being a half-breed, and who was later killed in action. However I could not stay anywhere for long because it was too dangerous for those concerned, and so one morning Herr Kiewe also said to me, “My wife is going mad with worry,” the concierge had already been asking questions about me, and I would have to go. Frau Alexandra then took me in again for a couple of nights and during the day I went on looking continually, as Frau Landgraf, for a permanent place to stay. I had left some money with Dr Hirschfeld so that at least I was not penniless. Through a Jewish dealer, who incidentally had seriously cheated me, I had sold silver, crystal, down-filled quilts etc. and given Dr Hirschfeld the proceeds. Apart from this, he had been able to withdraw a certain sum out of my blocked account for a supposed further operation. Once I thought I had found a room in Niederschönhausen, though this would have cost 50 marks per month and did not even have a stove. Despite this I paid out straight away in order to secure it for myself, but this woman also went back - 10 - on her agreement with me again, with a flimsy excuse. Once again Dr Hirschfeld knew what to do. He had the address of a Christian dressmaker in Charlottenburg where a Jewish married couple were living under false names. The dressmaker knew however that they were Jews, and although she also knew that I was a Jew she promised to take me in first of all and accepted a deposit of 20 marks. Incidentally, the husband of this couple was working as a plumber’s assistant in a business and his employer also knew that he was Jewish. When I then – again towards evening - went there with my small pack of things, the dressmaker said to me, “ I cannot take you and have already given the deposit for you back to my lodger.” It was already dark but she did not even want to give me shelter for just one night. At the time a man who I did not know was sitting in the kitchen and had sympathy for me. As I could hardly help myself in the dark because of my eyesight, he took me to the nearby telephone box so that I could call the Kiewes who then really did take me in with them again for one night, even despite their great fear. On the list that I had got from the agency there was one room left which did not sound very promising, as it would only cost 25 marks per month. It was at 8, Schenkendorf Strasse on the raised ground floor. The owner was a Fräulein Elfriede Wilde. She was crippled and expected her lodger to go and get food for her and spend a long time queuing up for it, and to cook for her. She was about my age, 60. She herself lived in a pretty room where she spent all the time sitting in an easy chair by the window with her crippled legs resting on a stool. We got on quite well straight away and I was also fully prepared to undertake the duties that would be expected of me. However when she then sent me off into the room that I would occupy, after I had asked to see it, I could not make my mind up to take it straightaway despite my great need. It was really just a partitioned area with no window, but its dim light came from a window past the kitchen. Almost the whole space was taken up by an awful bed and another part was separated off and served as a coalhouse. From there a stairway led into the cellar from which rose an icy, musty air. When I told Dr Hirschfeld about the facts of the matter he sent me very firmly back there, as the outward circumstances of an invalid single lady were exactly those, which would be safest for me. So I moved in with Fräulein Wilde and spent 2½ years there. I had already worked out a story, which I would tell her and everybody else and which corresponded as closely to the truth as possible, so that I was covered if ever I made a slip. My husband had just died. He had been the owner of a small business and we had done quite well. But since his death I had no income and had lost my home - 11 - in the bombing. My daughter had been taken on as a serving maid in Switzerland. Fräulein Wilde was a Communist and although she did not know that I was Jewish she always gave the impression of being very friendly towards Jews. She also had some work done on my bed by an upholsterer, offered me her chaise longue to sleep on at lunch times and often called me in in the evenings to listen to the radio with her. She did at least admit that this had been stolen from a Jew. Under these circumstances I often listened to lovely concerts, but often speeches by Hitler and Goebbels too! However it was now necessary to take a further, dangerous hurdle. It is true that I had false identity papers, but still no food ration cards. In order to get these I had to complete certain forms and go to the police with them. I simply had not summoned up the courage to do that. At first I asked Frau Opiora to go for me; she had even promised to do it, but simply never got round to it. I then went to our concierge, told her that I did not like going out on the streets because of my eyesight and asked whether she would get the cards for me in return for a good tip. She did agree to do it and when I went to her – trembling! – in the evening, she handed me the cards. Now I needed to have my name registered and in order to do this I needed the cancellation of my registration from the shops in which the (real) Frau Landgraf from Augsburger Strasse had had her name registered. However the real Frau Landgraf was still alive and I did not dare to expose myself to any questions there in her neighbourhood and put at risk my new identity, which had been so painstakingly put together. Thank God Fräulein Wilde had become so unworldly through being crippled that I could fob her off by saying that I would rather stay with the old shops because I was well known there, and although that was technically entirely forbidden, she believed me. It was a help to me that I exchanged the food ration cards then into so-called travel vouchers with which I could get something to eat in restaurants, although it is true that the food was expensive and poor quality, but of course I could not buy any food for daily household requirements. Here Frau Alexandra proved herself to be a good friend and gave me bread cards which were freely available and packed up several food parcels. From time to time Elli also gave me something to eat or a couple of marks, and in this way I went hungry throughout these difficult years. At that time coal was so scarce that my friends could not give me any, but as Fräulein Wilde kept her coal in my room I simply stole some from her whenever I sometimes just wanted to sit in my room. Fräulein Wilde, who was dependent on outside help, was looked after by a woman who had been placed with her by the N.S.V. This woman was quite a cunning thief who stole from both her and me quite openly. Fräulein Wilde could not move physically, and I felt myself to be in so much danger that I simply did not dare to put up a fight. Often when I had to leave the house to - 12 - go and stand in a queue for a long time, I hid my little bit of food under my bed. I also had to avoid doing anything which would draw attention to myself. Every Wednesday I would go to Frau Alexandra to get myself something to eat. I had agreed this right from the beginning with Fräulein Wilde, and “paid” for the food by doing some ironing and mending. Furthermore, I had also left some of my things with Frau Alexandra, which I could use to get money. If at that time “food” was the focal point of existence for everyone, and without the help of these good people I would probably not have survived at all, it was just as important for me that at least once a week I was allowed to be in a cultured atmosphere and a human being among other human beings. Strangely enough my life did not lack its lighter moments. So one morning in springtime I said to Fräulein Wilde that I would so much like to go out somewhere into the country, and she advised me to take the 98 bus to Treptower Park. A particularly nice looking woman got on the bus with whom I got talking and who then joined me in a walk. She soon began to curse Hitler dreadfully, announced that she was a Communist and asked me to go with her to her friend. I then became very good friends with this Frau Schwade. Soon I even became a member of her “circle”, a group of nice Christians, none of whom were Nazis however. Through this contact I then sometimes mixed with people, even went with the ladies to the theatre and the cinema. However my days, and especially the nights, were always overshadowed by the fear of being discovered. And again and again things happened which reminded me that in reality I was as free as a bird. So through my daughter’s friend, Frau Lilion Dumke (wife of Dumke the actor), I had made contact with her mother who was also living under a false name (Frau Bernhardt) and who sometimes came to me because her own room had no heating. Before she went underground under a false name she had left a letter behind in which she said she would throw herself into the Spree and that her daughter was not her husband’s child, but anAryan. In this way she had given her daughter a chance of life. She herself then got hold of some false papers in the name of Bernhardt for 8,000 marks through a Jew. One day I telephoned her and a strange voice answered, saying that something was not right with Frau Bernhardt, she was no longer there and her whole room had been ransacked. I then heard from her daughter, that the Jew who had provided her with the false papers had been snatched - 13 - and he had been promised his freedom if he betrayed the people to whom he had given papers. Like all of these people he was taken to the Alexander Platz and from there deported. Whenever I heard something like this I always feared for my life and each small incident made me panic. So I remember that one day a policeman came into our apartment and asked about Fräulein Wilde. When he left some time later and I went to her in her room, out of my mind with worry, and asked what he wanted, it turned out that she had been applying monograms to his laundry for him! In order to be on a more secure footing I once wanted to try to get a so-called postal identity card. I arranged for acquaintances to transfer small sums of money to me so that the postman who delivered money orders would get to know me, and I backed this up with good tips. When one day then he already addressed me as “Frau Landgraf”, I said to him that I would really like a postal identity card because so often I was unable to be at home when he came. Yes, he was quite willing to get me one. And he readily arranged an appointment for me with the Postal Superintendant. When I then met this official and showed him my false papers, he asked for a marriage certificate. I did not have one and promised to write to my “home authority” for one. However I no longer dared to approach Frau Landgraf’s register office for yet another copy of a document, and spent many weeks living in great fear that I had given myself away. But nothing happened. In the meantime the air raids on Berlin were becoming worse and worse. Often there was no time between the raids to pick up the dead off the streets. Influenza and dysentery were the inevitable consequences of the unhygienic conditions in which so many half-starved people lived closely packed together. That summer I often felt very unwell too, but dared not become ill and confined to bed because I was afraid of giving myself away or drawing attention to myself. One day however I was so weakened through dysentery and the constant hunger that I collapsed unconscious in the street. I do not know how I got home, but Fräulein Wilde sent word to Elli about me and she then even came and looked after me and as so often gave up some of her own meagre rations for me. The air raids did bring one good thing with them: there was a lot of wood lying around on the streets which I would gather up after dark in order to be able to sometimes heat my room. I think that by now Fräulein Wilde had noticed my occasional incursions into her coal stocks and had no longer had a warm room for some time. But with the general lack of coal - 14 - the entire population had their eye on the wood in the streets, and the thieving person who looked after Fräulein Wilde then also helped herself to the piled up supplies of wood of the other tenants, which was then reported to the police. So one day, to my unspeakable terror, another policeman then came to our door. Despite being overtired through the constantly disturbed nights, I tried to carry on looking after Fräulein Wilde by queuing for hours for food. At first we had sometimes eaten together but when my friends were able to give me less and less, and I often had nothing to eat at all, I was afraid that Fräulein Wilde would notice this and I suggested to her that we should give up communal mealtimes, as often I did not share her tastes. For heaven’s sake, I could not be allowed to turn this person against myself and deprive myself of my only base. She never shared the least bit of food with me during the whole 2½ years, but I could not allow even that to annoy me. Furthermore, as she was crippled and never left her room, she also often sent me out so that I could bring her reports of the devastation all around us – a further danger for me, as immediately after the raids many police, military and uniformed officials appeared, faced with whose questions or demands to see my identity cards I always trembled. During the raids I usually brought Fräulein Wilde to the windowless lavatory where we often spent the entire night (she full of terror and me cramped). Of course I would now have been able to go in the proper air raid shelter, but with the many foreign workers, homeless, deserters etc. raids were often carried out on these, and of course I could not expose myself to that. Through the long hours of queuing, often with hundreds of people, I got a good insight into the psyche of the population. As at that time there were no Jews at all left in Berlin, the Jewish Problem was no longer discussed. However some people still believed in a German victory, and when Berlin was already lying in rubble and ashes, the people around me were still reading Hitler’s praises in the newspapers, and they believed in the miracle weapon which could still turn the tide at the very last minute. Even my loyal Elli asked me one day, “What will you do, when you finally have to make yourself known as Frau Gassenheimer again after we have won the war?” Above all, her contact with me was becoming increasingly dangerous for her and one day, when I was gathering berries with her in the woods near Buckow, she said that one of her female cousins had seen us together and recognised me as Dr Cohn’s mother-in-law and had warned her that she could lose her life if she continued to associate with me. She would therefore not be permitted to see me again. All my - 15 - crying and pleading did no good. She took her leave of me. But four weeks later she was standing once again on my doorstep – her conscience was giving her no peace. Otherwise many a Christian German also helped me. Whether they knew that I was a Jew was never discussed but just accepted. Fräulein Wilde always sent me to the public lending library for example, to fetch really worthless “light reading” for her, and gradually I got to know the young librarian there. One day she told me that she knew Hans Albers and particularly respected him because he had given his Jewish girlfriend so much support. Since then she would sort out for me the best and newest books, which she had usually already put aside for me. Thanks to this constant supply of good books the time in my miserable room never seemed too long, and after I had spoken to Fräulein Wilde a few times about my reading she even had a small reading lamp put in for me. All this reading naturally did my eyes no good and I soon needed even stronger spectacles. But as the Christian Frau Landgraf, Dr Hirschfeld was no longer allowed to prescribe for me. Even with this I was helped by a Christian doctor to whom I was sent, a Dr Semmler from the hospital in the neighbourhood (the name of it escapes me). Without asking too many questions, he made sure that I got a new pair of spectacles. Of course it was also dreadful that – without proper ration cards – I had no opportunity to buy new clothes and linen, or of looking after them properly, as in the end even the sale of sewing thread etc was only permitted on cards. By the end I looked like a scarecrow. My shoes were particularly tattered, and even leather for repairs was only available on special sections of the ration cards. The air raid warden of the building helped me; he had been very nice to me and contrary to all his orders did not insist that I went to the air raid shelter. He had been a shoemaker and repaired my shoes and gave me some pieces of leather without a card. He also never asked me why I did not have any such ration cards. In her primitive way Fräulein Wilde naturally had little understanding of the agonies which I suffered in these dreadful surroundings, quite apart from my constant fear of discovery. For example the apartment had no bath, and I sometimes installed myself with 40 to 60 people in a public baths in order to have a warm bath, which she called a “silly fuss”. Whenever I went to the hairdresser to have my hair washed and in the middle of having it dried the electricity went off and I came home with wet - 16 - hair, she found that very funny. And not one single time could I be allowed to make her understand that the filth in which I had to live made me very miserable. I do not want to talk here about the last months of the war, with the mass bombing of Berlin by the Americans, and the terrible experiences which people had on a daily basis when they had to fight their way over piles of rubble and dead bodies to the food shops, because that was the fate of the Germans and not of the Jews. One Sunday morning in April 1945 Hitler announced that he would now distribute the reserves of food in Berlin, and Fräulein Wilde immediately sent me to our grocer’s shop where hundreds of people were already queuing. I had already been standing there for 4 hours when suddenly Elli appeared, sent by Fräulein Wilde because the Russian artillery was already so close that they were firing on the streets. Despite Elli’s pressing objection to my going back to the crippled Fräulein Wilde who could not help me, I returned to Fräulein Wilde’s apartment, which no longer had any windows or doors. We barricaded ourselves in the cellar as best we could but at 5 o’clock the following morning Elli stood in front of me and insisted that I go with her. We reassured Fräulein Wilde and I even gave her a bit more money and promised to return. Then we ran to Elli’s home through the streets, which by now were filled with smoke and ricocheting bullets like a battlefield. We threatened the Nazi concierge that we would immediately report her to the Russians if she did not let me in the cellar. We advised her to burn the picture of Hitler which was still hanging large as life in her concierge’s office, which (in tears!) she did. We spent two days and nights like this in the cellar without food or drink. With the Russian missiles and bombs fell German handbills, which said that the German people should wait, Hitler was putting together a new army, which would save Berlin and Germany! After two days we saw the first Russians from the cellar window. They were leading German men away because the SS were still shooting at them. We made ourselves white armbands and went up with our hands above our heads. Perhaps I should have made it known that I was Jewish immediately, but I still did not have the courage to do it. Elli knew some Russian through her Russo-German friend and she managed to communicate with the officers. Later we then confirmed what these first Russian officers said, namely that they were elite troops and we should not be afraid that they would rape and pillage, but it was the reinforcements who would take revenge for all the crimes that had been committed in Russia. After this Elli dared to go out on the streets and brought some food back, which the Russians had captured from the German army. They were still generously giving some of it to women and children, however shortly afterwards it would always be, “Food only if - 17 - you come with us.” For that reason it was very important that I could identify myself as a Jew in order to find protection and acquire legitimate food cards. Elli never left me alone during all this time, therefore we went first of all to the food office. On the way there we came to a shop of medical supplies that had been looted by the people. Elli took an electrical heat pad, of all things, and I took three maternity corsets. These did me very good service. I wore one of them myself; it was the first and only clean and intact piece of clothing that I had worn for a long time. Fräulein Wilde got the second one as thanks for her help, even if she had been unaware of giving it, and the third became a precious object for bartering in the period of starvation which then followed. Then came the unimaginable moment at the food office where I could be openly Jewish to a German official. The official behaved very properly, immediately gave me a so-called interim card, which only showed the 5 categories of supplies however, and recommended that I had myself identified by a person of authority. So Elli and I made our way to the Jewish Hospital, which took from early in the morning until late in the evening. Trains were no longer running, all the bridges had been blown up, many streets were completely blocked with debris. Fires were still burning everywhere, and everywhere lay dead bodies and dead animals, sometimes even single body parts. And everywhere white handkerchiefs were being waved out of the smouldering buildings. As we finally arrived in Iranische Strasse we were told that Dr Hirschfeld did not come in on Monday. I was then directed to the leader of the camp behind the hospital, where Jews and half-breeds were camping out in the open. These were the last people who had still been living in the Jewish Hospital because of illness or for other reasons, and had then simply been directed to the camping site as beds and shelter were needed for the many wounded. Here they were waiting for the transport to the east, and I will never forget the sight of these people who were completely starved and dressed in tatters, who were dancing round the campfire because they had now been saved. In the meantime night had fallen, we were completely exhausted by the long journey, and so we spent the night with the other Jews, shivering with cold under the open skies. The next morning I went back into the hospital. The Germans who were there were very nice and everyone wanted to help when I made it known that I was a Jew. By chance I met a man there from the Baltic who knew my daughter, and who had once warned me about informers when I went to her apartment to fetch myself something after she had fled. This man and a nurse from the hospital became my witnesses that I was Frau Gassenheimer and Jewish, and they wrote me out a certificate to that effect. On the way home we saw a crowd of people in the neighbouring street, - 18 - Leipziger Strasse. Heartened by a courage that was quite new to me, I mixed with people, something that I had avoided if possible for years – and saw that a Luftwaffe supply depot was being looted. People were wading in flour, because the sacks had been torn apart by bullets. A boy gave me a cardboard box with tubes from a crate. We did not know what they contained. But it later turned out to be Nescafe, which for us became something almost priceless to be bartered for other foods. In the meantime, Elli had got a sack of onions from a Russian. When we came back home heavily laden, my story had already been spread. All the tenants were very nice and brought their small treasures. One lady, who had been raped, had got 5 pieces of nougat from a Russian and even offered some of it to me. We had enough from our raid to be able to live off for about two weeks. Supplies to the population after the Russians had invaded had completely collapsed. There was simply nothing, and complete chaos reigned. As electricity was only available at night between 1 and 2,we cooked at night and usually also ate our strange meals at night. During the day Elli had to clear up rubble. Russians with fixed bayonets had taken her away to do this. As a Jew, I did not need to work. I tried as hard as I could to look after our small home. There was no water so I could not do much scrubbing! Then one day when I fetched water from a pump where dead horses were still lying I promptly got another case of dysentery. In addition, the house was swarming with insects. In the meantime I had been to the office in Charlottenburg and as a Jew got food ration cards of category 3; I was therefore somewhat privileged compared to the normal private individual. I had also been given some money at the office. One day I went to my old friend, Herr Kiewe, and asked him to go with me to my old apartment to try to get some of my things. The concierge was barely recognisable, I was now “Madam” once again and she could not do enough for me. She even offered me coffee – at that time the greatest of all treasures! I asked her for a statement that I had lived there, which she willingly gave me, and asked me again and again not to report her, she wanted to return all my things back to me. A few days later I found my son-in-law’s address in England sewn into the seam of my coat. Furthermore, I tried to set in place enquiries about my relatives through the Jewish community which had necessarily reorganised itself in the Jewish Hospital. But there was no one still alive. However I then heard from an acquaintance, Frau Bär, who had returned from Theresienstadt and was now - 19 - living in an old people’s home, and called on her, as before her deportation I had asked her to try to find my sister and sister-in-law in Theresienstadt. I found her, so wasted away she was unrecognisable, with 6 other women of a similar appearance in a room at the home. She told me that she had immediately asked about my sister when she arrived in Theresienstadt, however she had died the previous day from dysentery. My brother-in-law, who was very ill, had been thrown from the train, dead. My sister-in-law, who as I mentioned previously had paid a large sum of money for Theresienstadt, was able to keep herself there for a year and a half. Then one day she was summoned to a transport to Germany “for construction”, in reality however was sent to the gas chamber. Frau Bär herself had had to clean the lavatories and became so ill that she was taken to hospital and was still there when the Russians liberated Theresienstadt. Some of the women, who shared the room with Frau Bär, told me they were ready waiting for a transport with rucksacks on their backs, but the train (the last one to Auschwitz) only held 300 and there were too many of them, and in this way they were saved. At the beginning of July I came home one day from my raid for foodstuffs and found waiting there for me an English officer, who had brought me a letter from my daughter in Switzerland – the first sign of life since she fled. Through this Captain Scherer I then had a wonderful protector and helper. First of all he drove me in his military vehicle to the American military authorities in order to try to find an apartment, possibly my old apartment in Günzel Strasse. The Americans gave me a letter to take with me to the British authorities and at the accommodation office in the British Sector they were certainly willing to help me, however the building had been partially bombed and was fully occupied. A family, who at that time had been evacuated, had been living in my own former apartment; my furniture was no longer in existence. The concierge certainly gave me back some of my possessions so that at least I had the most essential things, and first of all I moved back into my old apartment, which had been allocated to me as long as the real owners had gone away. After years I had accommodation worthy of a human being, and however close the bond I had with Elli because of everything that had happened, I asked her to leave me alone in the apartment for a week and slept almost all the time. Some time later a Herr Heilbronn came to me who was my sister-in-law’s landlord. He had also been living illegally under a false name and had been evacuated from Berlin to East Prussia with other old people where things had gone well for him. At the moment he was running a lively black market business; as he himself said, he was already earning a small fortune again. He immediately offered to lend me some money and gave me 500 marks as I no longer had anything. - 20 - After four weeks the owners of the apartment returned. The husband behaved very nastily towards us, so that even the official in the accommodation office advised us to allow them to move back in, and after much trouble and many difficulties Elli and I eventually found two furnished rooms in Ludwigkirch Strasse. Even if the danger for me of illegality had now passed, the period that followed in the ruins of Berlin was still a very difficult time in my life. Also of course we still came across anti-Semitism. For example when I tried to get some furniture in a furniture showroom the owner said to me, “Too many Jews have come back,” and once when I tried to go into a cinema with my identity card as a “victim of Fascism” without going to the end of the queue I was sworn at extremely rudely. Officially we Jews were well treated. We got the so-called worker’s food ration cards, which meant double rations. The city of Berlin paid us 35 marks per month pension and in addition a one-off payment of 450 marks. But all that could not have satisfied our hunger, had we not received the marvellous parcels from the American Jews, which we were able to collect every four weeks. Through the Joint Distribution Committee we also got warm blankets and surplus goods from the American army. I lived like this in Berlin for another 2 years, during which I continually tried to get to England or America. There was a Jewish community office where we were given advice with a lot of understanding. After countless visits to the American and British authorities an English official asked me one day, “Was it your daughter, who has published a book about her escape?” When I told her that it was, she promised to expedite my petition and a very short time afterwards I had my visa and came to England with a Red Cross transport. generated an exception: Error code: 400 - {'error': {'message': \"This model's maximum context length is 8192 tokens, however you requested 9563 tokens (9563 in your prompt; 0 for the completion).

      "The History of the Jewish Community of Oppeln O/S. From its Beginning until its Destruction Oppeln – early history We can be fairly sure that long before the first half of the fourteenth century there were Jews already living in Oppeln. Centuries before that time merchants from and to South East Europe were already using the same routes and this trade was mainly in the hands of Jews. On the one hand the trade route led from the Ukraine and Galizien to Breslau and Frankfurt on the Oder via Brody, Krakau and Oppeln via which wool, furs hair, tallow, flax, and tobacco products were taken to Central Europe to be processed there, whilst textiles and steel products, glass and other goods went to the East ready to be consumed. The Free State of Krakau presumably protected its independence as a state from 1793 until 1848, when it was annexed by Austria, by imposing taxes on transit traffic, for the Schlachta, the landed gentry, did not pay any taxes and the farmers had no property. Moreover, Rosenberg, which was only 35 kilometres away from Oppeln, was the main point of entry for the import of the above-mentioned raw materials and especially of slaves who were ‘traded’ in great numbers to France and Spain from Poland and the Sarmatian countries. And this slave trade was very much dominated by Jews which follows from laws passed by the Merovingians against this trade and against the circumcision of slaves, from decisions of the councils and from the decrees issued in the small states in Spain before, during and after the age of Ibn Schaprut. The evil habit of having one’s slaves circumcised in order to safeguard one’s property – slaves became free by being baptised – was probably often useless because the church also accepted circumcised converts. In about 1200 in Rosenberg, a duty of 2 Oppeln Weisspfennigs had to be paid to the bishop of Breslau for every slave. In Oppeln the transports of slaves and products had to cross the Oder – the ships carrying goods from Mähren were drawn here across a weir which controlled the flow of the Oder (at the Friedländerschen Schlossbrauerei). Even when the Jews were expelled as was done by the Oberlandeshauptmann of Schlesien 1690-1693 the authorities exempted those Jews[i]who were innkeepers, brokers and haulage contractors living on the important trade routes in the interest of this traffic because the Jewish importers would have stayed away if it had no longer been possible for them to get kosher food on their journey. On our estate, there was a stable until 1875 in which the post kept 90 horses. - 2 - These and another 30 were necessary to cope with the traffic several weeks before and after the Breslau wool fair before the railway line was opened. The passengers were almost exclusively Jews from the East. - 3 - Oppeln The Synagogue community of Oppeln which has never had more than 650 members has always carried out their duties to the Jewish community. So they had belonged to the association of the synagogue communities of Upper Silesia[1]ever since it was founded, and as one of the eight bigger ones among the more than 40 communities had always had a seat on the committee. Since 1843 Oppeln had always had a rabbi, the religious rite was liberal (harmonium, later an organ, a female choir) – Oppeln and Oberglogau were the only communities in Upper Silesia that sent representatives to the synods convened by Arb and Philippson. When Capistrano delivered his sermons of hatred in Latin he had thousands of followers though they did not even know or understand a single word of that language. In Breslau this resulted in the deaths of 21 martyrs who were burnt at the stake on the Salzring (Blücherplatz), among them a certain Abraham von Oppeln which shows that at that time there were Jews already living in Oppeln. There are also names ‘mi jopel’ entered in the Black Death memory book of Metz. At the end of the 16th century when the duchies of Oppeln and Ratibor had been pawned to the dukes of Ansbach in exchange for a loan given to the House of Habsburg Oppeln and four more towns in the area lodged a complaint about the Jews to the government in Ansbach . They (ie the Jews) were accused of arbitrarily increasing the sum of debts later after they had done business on credit with the rural population. This government then decreed: debts to Jews will only have to be serviced if the mayor (the local head of administration) has documented it[2]. On the Monday after Martini 1564 Emperor Ferdinandus Primus (whose signature is also on the founding document of the Catholic Grammar School in Oppeln) in his castle in Pressburg (Bratislava) granted ‘seiner liewen und getrewen Stadt Oppeln’ like other Silesian towns, too, a privilege in Bohemian language ‘de non tolerando judaeos’[3]. Therefore 18 house owners and nine tenants had to leave ‘die Stadt, die Vorstädte und um die Stadt herum’ within one year after they had sold their houses[4]and collected their outstanding debts. Later they were allowed to stay longer. Until 1746 Oppeln was ‘judenrein’ . In that year Friedrich II , endeavouring to get industries established in Upper Silesia, an agrarian province that he had acquired only recently, gave Marcus Pincus, a Jew ‘from Austria’, a general privilege to establish a Pfundleder factory and a tobacco and delicatessen shop in Oppeln. For this shop the regulations for the guild were broken, which had always been strictly kept against the Jews and which stipulated that only 12 ‘Reichskrämer’ were allowed in Oppeln (100 in Breslau). On the basis of this general privilege Marcus Pincus came to Oppeln with his family, his brother, a ‘Praeceptor’ (private tutor), a kosher butcher (Schochet) - 4 - and several ‘Famuliz-Personen’ (assistants). The descendants of Marcus Pincus later also called themselves Österreicher, after their fatherland, and one son who had worked as a clerk in Königsberg in Preußen adopted the name ‘Königsberger’. The tannery was in the Friedländersche Haus[5]in the Schloßstraße, which had been built by Marcus Pincus, the shop was in the Graf Garniersche Haus on the southwest corner of the Ring . Before 1807 Marcus Pincus’ son emigrated to Warschau, which at that time was Prussian. Over the following years more Jews must have tried to get permission to settle in Oppeln, for in about 1770 the Council requested the Cabinet of War and Domains in Breslau to stop the immigration of Jews and they also handed in their privilege of 1564 which had been translated by the translator juratus into the Bohemian language. The Cabinet replied, ‘We will protect you and your rights against the Jews.’ The Old Prussia collapsed at Jena, Auerstedt, Saalfeld and Deutsch-Eylau, the reactionary Großkanzler von Goldfuss had to give way to Stein, Hardenberg and Fr. Humboldt . In 1810 there was the liberation of the farmers, which was followed by a law allowing people to move to wherever they wanted to live in the kingdom, by a new regulation for the towns and finally by the so-called ‘Judenemanzipationsedikt’ of 13 March 1812. Although it was not restricted simply to the terse sentence ‘Same rights, same duties’ which Hardenberg and his right hand GeheimerRegierungsratWagener wanted, it made the Jews ‘Einlieger’ and citizens and promised more rights to come. Nevertheless the aldermen of Oppeln refused to grant citizenship to the Jews on the basis of their privilege of 1564. Against this Israel Wolff Cohn from Zülz (six generations of his family had been living in Oppeln) appealed to the War and Domain Cabinet in Breslau (the government of Oppeln came into existence only on 1 June 1816, consisting of a chief president, two directors, 18 aldermen, two assessors and another 50 civil servants). Mayor Jekel was given a severe rebuke: ‘It is your duty to take actions against unlawful decisions of the aldermen. The law of 13 March 1812 has cancelled all the privileges counteracting it.’ But it was only on 10 February 1814 that the first 12 Jews were sworn in as citizens[7]. Six had been attracted by the Zülz mokom kodesch , the reservoir of the synagogue communities of Upper Silesia. Some had already acquired citizenship in other towns because the town council levied only 3 Taler as a citizen fee instead of 6 Taler as a fee for office work. Among these twelve there was also Josef Schnitzer, the chairman of the synagogue community for many years, the grandfather of Eduard Schneider (Emin Pascha), explorer in Africa, doctor and an English governor in the Sudan. The Emin Pascha-Straße which had been named after him was renamed Ritterstraße about 1934 by order of the president of the administrative district ‘for reasons of traffic engineering’; the cupboard containing objects to remember him by disappeared from the town archive. - 5 - When Josef Schnitzer wrote his request to the town council to grant him citizenship he added that this was the one thing he still needed to make his happiness complete. In 1846 he moved with his daughter to Berlin, perhaps because he was full of grief that his widowed daughter-in-law had been baptised in Neisse together with her children Eduard and Melanie, but he was buried in Oppeln. Sein Sohn Leib (Louis) Schnitzer, der Vater von Eduard, hatte, bevor er in Oppeln seine Seidenwarenhandlung eröffnete, bei der väterlichen Firma des Sozialistenführers Ferdinand Lasalle in Breslau als Kommis konditioniert. In the year 1821 the tower of the town hall in Oppeln collapsed. (The same thing happened again in 1936). A collection was started to rebuild the tower, which brought in 1200 Taler already on the first day, and four Jews of Oppeln out of about 20 living there had contributed 700 Taler to that sum. The medical officer of the town, who had just won 50,000 Taler in the Prussian lottery, thought his contribution of 50 Taler to be appropriate. About 20 years later the Jewry paid the price for their exaggerated local pride. For when the town built a fire brigade depot in the Mühlgasse (starting from the north western corner of the Ring the Jewish community requested that a storey be built on top which they wanted to rent for use as their synagogue. The borough councillors rejected the request reasoning that even if a contract were made attested by a notary the Jews would always find a back door to escape their obligations. In 1834 the Government demanded that the municipal authorities check all Jews to find out whether they were Prussian citizens, and it turned out that at that time there were 49 Jewish families living in Oppeln (one of them was a bachelor); there were objections against nine but they were able to prove later that they were Prussian citizens. Of these 49 heads of family only seven were born in Oppeln, 14 came from Zülz, one ‘Brennknecht’ came from South Prussia, which had become Prussian only in 1792 when it was surrendered by Poland and later became the administrative district of Marienwerder, the other 27 came from 15 places in Upper Silesia. In 1875 a new check on citizenship followed, and several families who had immigrated from Poland without permission were expelled. The borough councillors reacted in very different ways to the requests for citizenship by Jews. So the wholesaler Ephraim dealing in rags received the answer, ’The Euphrat that wishes to give us the pleasure of his presence is perfectly free to come here and help us bear our ‘onera’ . When the wealthy wood trader Pniower applied for his transfer (to Oppeln) the president of the borough councillors, Beer[9], a master tanner, wrote to the mayor, ’Such individuals who will contribute a lot to our community will be very welcome indeed; therefore I request you on my responsibility to invite this Pniower immediately to swear him in as a citizen. I will present the consent of the assembled town councillors later.’ The town councillors granted the former tutor in Marcus Pincus’ house, Seeligman Pappenheim, ’citizenship out of their free will because of his long presence in this town, his old age and his uprightness and they released him from the citizen payment.’ - 6 - In 1839 Isaac Münzer from Kieferstädtel came to Oppeln, and at first opened an inn, but because this was not successful he together with his wife and his brother-in-law started to roll cigars. That was the cradle of the Upper Silesian cigar industry, which later employed several thousand workers in Oppeln and the region around it. In 1824 Marcus Friedländer had already established the Castle Brewery. In the year 1832 Dr Bernhard Friedländer[10]was the first Jewish doctor to practise in his hometown Oppeln. During the years 1831-40 there were 118 Jewish births and 44 deaths. Until 1816 when the Jewish cemetery was founded in Königlich-Neudorf the few funerals had to take place in Zülz. The money for setting up the cemetery was provided with shares belonging to the community, the last three of which were redeemed and paid back in the year 1925. It comprised about 1200 qm and they paid 30 Pfennige per 1qm for the ground. In 1932 they thought it necessary to buy more ground for a new cemetery and paid 1 Mark per qm for the ground, which was 5 kms from the town centre. In 1936 the town took this ground back, and the new cemetery could no longer be developed. In the year 1841 two Jews refused to be sworn in as citizens in the synagogue and demanded that this should be done as it was normally for Christians – and as was already common practice in Brieg – in the town hall. But in reply to their inquiry the town council was informed that in Brieg also the Jews had to take all the oaths as citizens, and in a law court (eg as witnesses etc), in the synagogue as the law demanded. In the following session of the town council the candidate concerned then made a solemn vow to the head of the town council in the presence of the whole town council, and then repeated this act with all the members of the town council. (This ceremony is not stipulated by the law.)[11] Before the rabbinate was established weddings had been performed in Oppeln by the following people: the private individuals Josef Schnitzer and Bernhard ( who founded the society for building the synagogue), the rabbis Landsberger - Losslau, Karfunkelstein - Rybnik, Laqueur - Staedtel, Loewe - Schrau, Landsberg - Sülz, Dr Loewe - Bernstadt, Cohn - Sülz, the rabbi candidate Neustadt - Schwerin, the preacher Geiger - Breslau. In order to obtain citizenship the applicant had to attach to his application a certificate of good conduct issued by the town council of his present home. Thus the town council of Bernstadt certified that second lieutenant in the XK. Landwehr-Regiment Pringsheim had always been peaceful, honour-loving and had behaved in such a way as befitted his officer status[12]. Pringsheim established a shop for silk goods in Oppeln together with his brother-in-law and later collected the tolls in the Brieg district. Up to the year 1844 no Jewish baby was born out of wedlock in Oppeln (those illegitimate births taking place here later were probably mostly due to the fact that the provincial women’s hospital and the institute for midwives were situated in Oppeln) and for more than 30 years there was no Jewish divorce. At the community’s request the town council delegated one of their members as the commissioner for the executive elections. In the year 1844 - 7 - 34 out of the 54 persons entitled to vote did not appear, and when the two candidates received the same number of votes in the election the Catholic town councillor who acted as the commissioner also cast his vote in the second ballot to prevent another parity of votes. ‘Da das religiöse Band nicht mehr ausreiche, den Sonderbestrebungen Einzelner (so Steuerverweigerung) Schranken zu setzen‘ in 1844 the chairmen of the synagogue turned to the government in Oppeln asking them to certify a statute, which they themselves had drawn up and which the town council had advocated. At the same time a similar request had come from Ratibor. The government suspended their decision ‘until there is a new law for Jews’. In 1843 for the first time in Oppeln a rabbi was elected, Dr Salomon Cohn[13], the son of the rabbi of Zülz, and his income was fixed at 600 Taler per year (the post filled in Beuthen [Upper Silesia] at the same time was fixed at 500 Taler). Before Dr Cohn’s assumption of office his widowed mother had moved from Zülz to Oppeln[14]. The town council had advised the aldermen to accept her application since she would be able to spend 12 Taler per month from her property to support herself. In the year 1930 the number of members of the community had decreased to 480, to the size of 1836 (in 1930 roughly 1%, at that time 690 out of the whole population). In the year 1850 the aldermen granted a support of 13 (thirteen) Taler per year, which could be revoked any time, at the request of the community, for the Jewish school consisting of two classes (from 1 January 1851). The lessons were given by a Jewish teacher and a Catholic member of the seminar as his assistant, later two teachers were employed. This school existed until 1875, the last teachers were Nathan Rackwitz from Fraustadt and Loebel Jungemann from Hawitsch (he was also the cantor), whose son,JustizratAdolf Jungmann [sic] (Counsellor of Justice) was later the chairman, and his grandson, the lawyer Dr Otto Jungmann, was the secretary of the last community board. The town council had engaged the Catholic high priest and the Protestant superintendent to inspect the school in turns, at the request of the community board the rabbi was also called in. After the Jewish school had been dissolved the Jewish children were accepted by the Protestant ‘Volksschule’ for a school fee of 3 Marks per month. When under Hitler the Jewish children were expelled from the ‘Volksschulen’, a district school was established in Oppeln for the small number of only 12 children from Oppeln, Groß-Strehlitz and Rosenberg where Mr Spier, a teacher from Paderborn, who had so far worked at the urban Volksschule, now gave lessons. About 1845 the community board made a request to the government to be granted corporation rights. The request was rejected because, as they said, according to paragraph 13 of the Constitution, granting this right to religious corporations was reserved for future legislation. But they also said that the government nevertheless thought that passing such a law would soon be necessary and had drafted a relevant bill to be presented to the ’Ministerium in pleno‘[15], Referent - 8 - Regierungsratvon Aulock, CoreferentRegierungsratvon Gronefeld. The latter had acted as commissioner to constitute the Upper Silesian community unions after the law of 23 June 1847 had been passed (it refers to these unions); he had shown a lot of understanding and thus found a way out of the difficulties arising from the often contradictory requests especially of the small communities[16]. A governmental edict of the year 1853 deals with the fact that very often the wedding ceremonies which by law have to take place in the district law court, were often performed only when the first child was born because otherwise this baby was considered illegitimate. The community board was put under the obligation to make the people have the civil marriage ceremony on time. In 1857 Rabbi Dr Cohn left his field of activity, and Dr Adolf (Aron) Wiener, who came from Murowana-Goslin (on the border between Schlesien and Posen ) was elected as rabbi. He had studied the Talmud in Lissa and with Akiba Eger in Posen. He had taught himself as an autodidact[17]to be a teacher for the intermediate classes of the Neu-Stettin grammar school, had afterwards suffered the privations of the poor student, and after he had finished his studies had become a private teacher in Polen . Then he became a teacher in Grünberg in Schlesien, where he also consecrated the synagogue. Dr Wiener was active in Oppeln for 38 years, until the end of his life. His paper on the laws concerning food caused the Rabbi Cohn-Inowrazlaw to write a conservative pamphlet opposing his views. When Kaiser Wilhelm I died he delivered a sermon ‘Saul and Jonathan’ which made the Public Prosecutor bring in an indictment against him for offence against the sovereign, but the indictment was withdrawn. The immense reverence of his community had to make up for his meagre income – in the last decade of his life he earned 3000 Marks per year, which was about the same sum as that of a secretary in the administration – and the rabbi’s wife must have been as clever as her brother, the banker Mr Hermann, as far as the finances were concerned because on this income she had to manage the expenses of the big flat, food, clothing, school fees etc for the large family. It was only in 1857 that the regulations implementing the law for Jews of 1847 were passed and only then could the unions of communities be constituted. The idea was in general to use the same borders which defined the districts, but v[on] Gronefeld did not follow this rule whenever traffic connections and economic relations were not identical with them. Thus he integrated Ottmachau, district of Grotkau, into Neisse and Gogolin, district of Groß-Strehlitz, into Oppeln. Thus Krappitz, Gogolin and Proskau were filial communities of the community of Oppeln, whereas the small market town Carlsruhe was constituted as a separate community together with the neighbouring villages, all in all 60 families, 30 of which were living in the main place . The request of the Jews living there to be integrated into the village community of Staedtel, district of Namslau, which was only 7 km [kilometres] away, had been rejected by the government, probably because the district of Namslau belonged to the administrative district of Breslau[18]. Just a few sentences about the filial communities. The filial community Carlsruhe founded their cemetery in 1870; they also had a small synagogue, the architecture of which corresponded to that of the old synagogue in Oppeln. In Proskau there were only four families - 9 - families living in the village and five in the neighbouring villages. The Rabbi of Oppeln had authorised a merchant from there who was acquainted with Jewish traditions to swear people in as citizens and before the law court. These families had secured their claims on graves in the cemetery in Oppeln by paying 10 Taler each when they bought the graves and afterwards 1.5 Silbergroschen per month. The members of Krappitz[19], who had a cemetery of their own, paid altogether for their religious institutions, namely 21 Taler per year for the prayer room and 8 Taler for the cantor on the high religious holidays; the income of the religious instructor of 300 Taler per year was paid on Yom Kippur only by the four families who had children. The government’s idea to unite Krappitz with Proskau, which was only two miles away, had to be given up because travelling is forbidden on Sabbaths and religious holidays. In the year 1858 the community bought the synagogue which had been built in 1842 by the Synagogenbauverein and paid for with shares. Thirteen shareholders could then be paid off by compensating their sum required for redemption with the contributions the community had not yet received from their members. The chairmen, the lottery collector Bernhard, and the owner of a brewery Boronow (his brewery was later the Friedländersche Mälzerei on the Oderdamm) renounced the payment of 747 and 670 Taler respectively, which actually they ought to have received, the other shareholders were satisfied with 10% of the face value, and the 43 owners of pairs of seats sold at that time were paid off with 20% of the former price. In that year the two teachers received an income of 300 Taler per year, one of them an additional payment of 50 Taler for conducting the choir. The Kassel family paid for the big menorah; one of their descendants, Curt Kassel, became a rabbi in Melbourne (in the Australian state of Victoria) after 1938. The cemetery hall was built costing 1960 Reichstaler which were provided by a gift of 700 Taler, a credit of 700 Taler from the Chewra Kadischa, collections in the community amounting to 365 Taler, and 195 Taler from the sale of a small house and a plot of land outside the cemetery wall. By buying a plot of land for 340 Taler they enlarged the cemetery by one third of a Morgen. They also decided that on Yom Kippur in the Maskir only one third of the names should be read out. A request of the representatives to reduce the income of the Schammes from 100 to 72 Taler per year was rejected by the chairmen. The community consisted of 596 members in the year 1858, which was more than 6.5% of the population of the town with its 8,989 inhabitants. In the year 1861 the plan to build a second women’s overhanging gallery in the synagogue fell through because the owners of the men’s seats objected that it would cut out their light. Because Cantor Hirsch declared that he was not able to meet the pay claims of a salaried choir with the 50 Taler per year which he had been allowed for this, the sum was raised by 1 Taler and 2.5 Silbergroschen per month. In 1862 there was a plan to buy a house near the synagogue for 3,500 Taler, having received a cost estimate and a plan from the builder Schindler to have it converted into flats for the rabbi and the cantor and - 10 - into classrooms. But the sale came to nothing. For a statue of G E Lessing in Berlin the community collected 19 Taler. In 1863 serious quarrels which endangered the peace in the community were settled by a unanimous decision of the chairmen and the representatives. The rabbi’s salary was increased from 600 to 700 Taler per year, that of the first cantor from 300 to 375 Taler, that of the second cantor and Jewish butcher from 200 to 225 Taler (plus fees for kosher butchering), the income of the Schammes from 150 to 162 Taler per year. The teacher earned 200 Taler and the book keeper Böhm 60 Taler per year. The community owned 350 Taler, the healthinsurancebelonging to the community had 200 Taler in the form of agricultural mortgage bonds. The villagers contributed 36 Taler to the community budget, and the three filial communities paid together 28 Taler. The rabbi was urged to attend the school lessons for one to two hours every day because his presence would influence the pupils’ attitudes and achievements in a positive way. In the year 1864 the remaining five shares of the Synagogenbauverein were bought and the school was reorganised. The salary of the first teacher was raised to 400 Taler, and instead of a student teacher a full-time teacher was employed with a salary of 300 Taler per year but on a three-year rather than permanent basis. As the present cantors were leaving and there were no fresh candidates the community was obliged to offer a salary of 600 Taler for two cantors. Nevertheless there were vacancies and while they were not filled the community raised only 90% of the communal taxes. Ignoring a former resolution they offered one applicant from Ofen only 400 Taler; this man and another one who had been chosen did not turn up nor did another cantor from Gleiwitz who had been chosen and had been offered 450 Taler and a job for 10 years. In 1866 a request by the representatives to dissolve the Jewish school in order to save the expenses was rejected by the chairmen. The rabbi had asked for a pay rise but received instead only a single extra payment of 50 Taler, the other employees were granted 5% equalling 70 Taler of the list of dues as gratuities for the festivals. According to this this list consisted of 1400 Taler. Oppeln and the three filial communities were able to send 47 Taler, 27 Silbergroschen and 3 Pfennige to the National-Invalidenstiftung . This money was the result of a collection and a contribution of 20 Taler from the communal treasury. In 1867 an emergency exit was built in the synagogue after the municipal authorities had refused to sell the community the piece of land adjoining the synagogue plot at its southern end (which later became the Friedländersche Garten). The property of the community had increased to 900 Reichstaler in bonds, 400 Taler of mortgages, 800 Taler of outstanding debts, and 30 Taler in working funds, all together 2,400 Taler. The community’s budget closed with 2,975 Taler. (In detail: the assessment roll /tax list/ of the people living in the town was only 1,354 Taler, the one of the people living in villages or in the filial communities was - 11 - 60 Taler, fees for kosher butchering were 350 Taler, fees for renting a seat in the synagogue 400 Taler, school fees 240 Taler, donations 948 Taler and the holiday gratuities for the communal employees, which had been increased to 10 percent, 146 Taler, interests 126 Taler, contributions of the municipal administration to the school 1893 Taler and 10 Silbergroschen - the tax list produced less than 50% of what was needed. And there was the list of expenses: salaries including the school 1893 Taler, holiday gratuities 146 Taler, rent for the school building 200 Taler, welfare 124 Taler, other things the school and the synagogue needed 309 Taler, unforeseen costs 94 Taler and 30 Taler at the chairmen’s disposal.) Ten years later the budget had gone up to 3,347 Taler, which was the equivalent of 10,040 Marks. The budget of the Chewra Kadischa was balanced in 1867 with 277 Taler. In that year the Jewish population of Oppeln counted 650 people among 11,330 inhabitants, which was the highest number they had ever reached. The interest of a legacy that had fallen to the community was to be divided equally between the communal treasury and the employees. Also for that year the rabbi was granted an extra payment of 50 Taler and another 50 Taler to cover his expenses for the journey to the synod in Kassel (1868). The chairmen renounced their right to nominate the chairmen of the Chewra Kadischa and only reserved their right to nominate a commissioner who had the right of veto. From then on the general assembly of the Chewra elected their board of chairmen which was presided over by the rabbi. As late as 1868 the community was entered in the land register as being the owner of the synagogue. The conveyancer Langer received for this act 128 Taler, a certain assessor Schüter was paid 25 Taler for ‘the extra-official treatment’ of this business. For the following 70 years I have to rely on my memory. From 1937 the political situation did not allow the use of governmental documents as had been permitted in former times[20]nor could we request the government archives in Breslau to send us files which I had up to then used in the municipal archives in Oppeln. The chairmen’s books with the minutes, their files and their books of accounts had been handed over to the archive of the German Jews in Berlin. As for all the German Jews, April 1st 1933 also meant for the Jewry of Oppeln the end of their development. Until then the increase and decrease of their members had roughly balanced each other, the number of children had decreased just as in general. Together with growing affluence there were more taxes and charitable actions from the community. After 38 years in office Rabbi Dr Wiener died in 1895, having reached a great old age, and his successor was Dr Hermann Vogelstein, the son of the rabbi of the Stettin community who had written the highly controversial guidance rules. He [Dr Hermann Vogelstein] had already taught religious education at the grammar school and the sixth form secondary school for girls in Oppeln some months before in place of Dr Wiener who had been seriously ill. After only two years’ teaching Dr Vogelstein left Oppeln in order to take the position as the communal rabbi in Königsberg Preußen . While he was working in Oppeln the preparations for building a new synagogue in Wilhelmstal were started in Wilhelmstal, a part of the town of Oppeln, and the building was also completed[21]. - 12 - The first official function of Dr Baeck from Lissa in Preußen, elected in 1897, was the consecration of the new synagogue. About all the things he did during and after his 10 years in office in Oppeln the readers and the whole Jewish world are sufficiently informed. His lectures in the Jewish literary club, and especially his series of lectures on the Prophets, have provided the audience with insights into spheres which had often so far been strange to them. When Dr Leo Baeck went to Düsseldorf in 1907, Dr Felix Goldmann, born in London, the son of an East Prussian family, was elected as rabbi. This man, just like his predecessor Dr Bund, and all his successors, with the exception of Dr Braunschweiger, had studied in Berlin (and taken his exams) at the ‘Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums’. The earlier religious tensions (conservative – liberal) had been overcome long before but there were tensions between the C-V majority and the local Zionist group of about 20 members, mostly younger academics. Dr Goldmann was a keen supporter of the ideas of theC-V(in Leipzig he later became the president of its Saxonian association). Thanks to the efforts of respected citizens who strongly recommended that at the next election several also generally qualified Zionists should become members of the communal representation, too, the peace in the community was saved. A very great deal of Dr Goldmann’s activities consisted of his care for several hundred prisoners of war (mostly Romanians) on the training area of Lamsdorf during World War I. The small community of Ober-Glogau[22]with about 40 families subordinated themselves to his rabbinate. After 10 years in office in Oppeln Dr Goldmann accepted the call from the main community in Leipzig, who had elected him as their first rabbi, after the religious holidays in 1917. There he started a great deal of charitable and social activities, which were applied in particular to the ’Ostjuden’ who did not belong to his community, and their orthodox rabbi Dr Carlebach supported him absolutely. During his time in office and with his cooperation the liberty lodge UOBB had been founded in Oppeln with about 30 brethren in November 1911. The name had been chosen in view of the celebration commemorating the one hundredth anniversary of the emancipation edict in the following year. This edict had liberated the Jews from their insecure living conditions. The number of brethren later grew to about 50, 10 of whom came from other places, from Brieg, Rosenberg and Gogolin. Previously 11 brethren had become members of the peace lodge in Ratibor who transferred their admission fees to their affiliated lodge in Oppeln as a basic fund. The lodge has always honoured the motto of the order; they have, among others, supported the nursing staff of the synagogue community and were represented in the board of the synagogue, among their representatives, in the Chewra Kadischa[6][8]and in the Jewish women’s union, thus being on their board of trustees. The inauguration ceremony was attended, in addition to other guests of honour, by the Großpräsidenten of both the German and the Austrian districts,GeheimratTimmendorfer and Dr Sonnenschein, the Vice-Großpräsident and Groß-Schatzmeister of the eighth - 13 - district. Nearly all the guests of honour from Oppeln who had been invited to the brethren’s dinner later joined the lodge. Dr Goldmann was succeeded by Dr David Braunschweiger from Würzburg, a student of the conservative rabbi seminar, previously the second rabbi in Kattowitz, and finally the rabbi of the synagogue community in Rybnik, which has also become part of Poland. Though he worked in a synagogue which had an organ he nevertheless always kept to his conservative convictions, yet there were never any quarrels with the liberal majority of the community. Dr Braunschweiger had also been a candidate on the list which formed the compromise of Conservatives and Liberals and he was elected as their representative to the association of Prussian communities (besides him there were two conservative and two liberal representatives; one moderately liberal candidate became a member of the council. Two native Oppeln citizens (the author of this text at hand for the conservative line and the lawyer Dr Scheyer-Liegnitz for the liberals) had been authorised to conclude this compromise. In this Jewish parliament Dr Braunschweiger joined the ‘Mittelpartei’ which had been founded by Dr Ismar Freund and represented it on the executive committee. Dr Braunschweiger was also the chairman of the C-V Association of the Upper Silesia region. For 10 years – until 1927 – he was the rabbi in Oppeln. Unfortunately the last weeks of his life were embittered by a serious illness and an unsuccessful operation. During his time in office the ceremonies took place to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the synagogue, the highlight of which was the presence of his three predecessors, Dr Baeck, Dr Vogelstein, and Dr Goldmann. Also the students of the association of Jewish students in Breslau had sent a deputation with their flag. Both Dr Pfingst from Nordhausen and Dr Hohenstein from Königsberg in Prussia were in office for only two years each. Dr Hohenstein was a grammar school teacher at a grammar school there and had retired when he was just 40 years old to study theology. But he gave up in order to devote his life to independent literary activities in Berlin. After that several candidates from the Berlin School for Jewish Science looked after the rabbinate until in 1931 Dr Hans Hirschberg from Berlin was elected the new rabbi, who was very successful in satisfying the wishes for education in particular with his well-founded sermons and with essays in the communal paper that had been established in about 1932. He also invited capable members of the community to work with him. Dr Hirschberg, the last rabbi of the dying community, went to the USA, after he had been arrested on 10 November 1938 together with 23 members of the community. (Two others had asked for ‘protective custody’ by the SS after their homes had been demolished.) After the synagogue had been burned down in the night of 9 to 10 November 1938 when apart from the 12 Sifre Torah belonging to the community 30 others were also destroyed[23]the community procured the rooms of a former cooperage in the Gartenstraße for their services and the district school. The last Jewish families to move to Oppeln from Gogolin had brought the two Torah scrolls with them which Oppeln had lent to this - 14 - filial community 30 years before. So it was possible to carry on reading out texts from the Torah. The community decreased continuously – but unfortunately only slowly – due to emigration. All the members of the community now regularly attended the services. Having lost their livelihood and their property 40 men found excavating work to earn their living, but were employed in a separate gang of workers. The main task of the community council now consisted of promoting emigration and reorganising jobs. The wealth of the community – 40,000 Marks – had been lost during the time of inflation . After the end of inflation the community’s property slowly grew again to 20,000 Marks which were transferred to the representation of the Jews in the Reich. Destruction came rapidly. Thirty-five members and women died in Theresienstadt. All the others who had not emigrated belong to the martyrs who were cruelly killed, shot by the SS or gassed or burned in the East. Here is what happened to the members of the last community council: Erich Kassel (and his parents–in-law Max and Betty Friedländer to whom you, dear Doctor, were able to speak) managed to get to Stockton (California), the lawyer Dr Jungmann went to Sao Paolo (Brazil), myself and the chairman of the representatives Dr Lewinski to Cochabamba (Bolivia) and his deputy Hein to Quito (Ecuador). It came as a surprise to the pharmacist Schlesinger that he was released from Theresienstadt in order to go to Switzerland, Blumenthal died in Theresienstadt, the teacher Mr Spier was paralysed and was put on a wagon there that took him to his extinction in the East. The lawyer Harry Wolff suffered the same horrible fate; he had replied to me when I was urging him to apply for his emigration visa, ‘I want to experience the end here.’ Nemesis arrived, but it does not give us back the victims. Oppeln was destroyed by bombs to a very large extent, they say that there are only a few houses left between the station and the regional court. The German population – only a few stayed – was transported in special trains to Weiden (Oberpfalz) when the Russian armies were approaching. The Lord Mayor and chief of air raid protection for Upper Silesia (formerly a junior legal official) had announced: Don’t take a lot of luggage, we’ll be back in four weeks with the victorious German armies! In their place Poles were sent to settle there, among them 4,000 Jews, who took care of the Jewish cemetery, which had not been destroyed. On market days the town resembles a small Galician town, on the Ring there are the farmers’ carts where the horses are fed. Two German doctors who had once been highly respected were buried at the expense of the urban poor-relief fund[24]. The provincial senior medical officer and head of the provincial gynaecological hospital in Oppeln put aside his Nazi thinking and asked a former doctor from Oppeln in Rochester on Lake Ontario NM for a food parcel. - 15 - If now a German historian – I think it was Schlosser – says,‘The world’s history is the world’s judgement’ let us hope it will find a benevolent verdict on the lesson about Israel. - 16 - Notes [i]So in 1738 the Eastern Jews refused to attend the Breslau fairs if their Groß-Schamaschim (trade agents) were no longer allowed to live there, thus forcing the Breslau Council to repeal the expulsion of the Jews which had previously been carried out rigorously, and in his expulsion decree of 1745 Friedrich II expressly exempted those being generally privileged, those employed by the communities, those procuring coins and the ‘Genuine Polish Jews’ in Breslau from expulsion. (It was the job of the ‘Münzbesorger’ to procure genuine foreign silver coins which were then counterfeited in the Prussian mints in Berlin, Joachimstal, etc., managed by a Major General von Arnim; 144 Taler were later exchanged for 46 of real value. But the population used to say, ’Außen Friedrich, innen Ephraim’ – ‘Friedrich outside, Ephraim inside’. Ephraim merely procured the coins in a big way). [1]The Upper Silesian Union of Synagogue Communities was founded in 1888, the second one in Prussia; only the East Prussian Union had been established a few years before and the Lower Silesian one in 1898. At the request of the managing board I wrote an article for their fiftieth anniversary in 1938 ‘50 Years of the Upper Silesian Synagogue Union, A Retrospective’ and an attachment ‘The Domiciles of the Upper Silesian Jews over the past 250 Years’. These texts were confiscated by theGestapo, together with 40 brochures containing excerpts from documents of Jews from the national archive in Breslau, the government of Oppeln and the municipal councils of Oppeln and Krappitz when they searched my house on 10 November 1938. But there exists a carbon copy, which I left in Tel Aviv on my journey to Palestine. [2]The same problem had led to the establishment of 40 ‘Chirographar-Ämter’ in England and Wales. When these were abolished in 1200 the Jews lost all their property and were expelled in 1206. [3]The statement of defence presented by the advocate who had been engaged by the Jews of Oppeln probably together with Jews from other Upper Silesian towns who were also equally endangered, was without success: ’As the master leaves already at four (4 pm) to have his beer the the whole work is left to the journeyman and the apprentice alone. So the price for linen is so immense that the farmer would have to go naked if there was not the Jew who brought back cheap linen from the fairs in Leipzig and Braunschweig. Thus the Jews are not the oppressors but the benefactors of the poor people.’ – Besides the weavers the wood turners had also caused the council to make this request for reasons of competition. [4]These houses were mostly bought by the council to prevent the aristocrats living in the neighbourhood from laying hands on them for since they did not pay any taxes the municipal treasury would not have got the real-estate tax as had already been the case with the 12 ‘Freihäuser’ . Most Jews went to Poland, but some also to Venice, for in the ‘Urbar’ (the municipal book of accounts) of the following years sums are entered which were sent to a Jew in Venice. Obviously the rest of the money which the town had to pay for the house he had sold to the council. [5]The Friedländersche Haus is now the residence of the Polish bishop, the Minoritenkirche opposite (church belonging to the Franciscans minoris gravitatis) which Friedrich II had taken away and graciously presented to the five Protestant families now belongs again to the Catholics. The town gaol where the 24 of us underarrestwere put on 10 November 1938 with two more Jews who had searched for protective custody with the SS (!) until we were transferred to the remand prison was the monastery of the Minoriten. The one of the Franciscans maioris gravitatis was on the ‘Gymnasiumberg’ . In former times learned monks taught at the grammar school. Friedrich II granted - 17 - two more privileges to trimmings manufacturers from Sachsen in Oppeln. Against the expert opinion of the inspector locorum (authority between 12 councils and the war and domain cabinet in Breslau), Krieges- und Steuerrat Schroeter in Neisse: ‘ a population who has so far not done anything else but fattening pigs and brewing beer is unsuited for more delicate industries.’ Schroeter was right, for after the two people from Saxony had spent a part of the credit from the state amounting to 3,000 Taler each on ‘Verposamentieren’ they crossed the Polish frontier taking the rest with them. [6]The Higher Court of Appeal was later transferred to Ratibor. In its library, which had been left to the regional court in Ratbor and which was managed by a Jewish associate judge of a ‘Landgericht’ I later found valuable material for my research work in the home of the associate judge of the regional court, Dr Krebs. [7]The taking of the oath was performed in the synagogue, in front of the assessor (kantor), the candidates wearingtallitand tefillin and holding a Sefer Torah in their arms, in the presence of two witnesses and a representative from the council (usually the mayor who received a fee of one Reichstaler for it). The candidate had put on the uniform of the civic guard (garde bourgeoise) or that of the shooting club, in complete armour, which was considered more distinguished. This citizen oath corresponded with the oath the Jews had to take in the law court and which was not abolished before 1869 but there was an addition ‘to further the welfare of the town and to be loyal and obedient to His Majesty, the King of Prussia’. Because the 12 candidates were divided into six groups for taking the oath there were already two Sifré Torah available when the synagogue community was founded. [8]That the honesty of the municipal administration did not amount to much is demonstrated as follows: the large bridge across the Oder had been constructed with the help of a credit from the state. At the same time a bridge toll had been fixed, the yield of which was to be used to pay off this credit, but was never paid to the treasury. That must have escaped the notice of the chief audit office. At this bridge there was a pole with a plaque attached to it which bore the inscription: ‘Toll for a Jew and a pig is 1 Heller’ (Cf. Mendelsohn’s entry into Berlin’). One night in November 1848 the pole was sawn off by Veitel Kassel and a Count Reichenbach and thrown, together with the plaque, into the Oder when the river was flooding. This aristocrat who, ‘did not take after anyone in the family’, in 1848 made revolutionary speeches in the Posthof (our father’s property, Malapanerstraße 2). Professor Frielitz from the University of Breslau writes in his book ‘100 Years of Silesian Agricultural History’ that a Count Reichenbach, whose estates in the district of Trachenberg and Polish-Wartenberg had been raised to the status of mediatized territory by Friedrich II [of Prussia], had caused a major quartered with him during a manoeuvre to ride with his squadron across the nearby Polish frontier and to bring back a number of farmers with their - 18 - farming equipment, who had fled to Poland and settled there to escape the oppression by the Count. The Count punished them severely and had the ringleader sent to do hard labour at fortifications. The minister for Silesia, who had wished to take the Count and other aristocratic oppressors of the farmers to court, lost his office and His Majesty’s favour because his behaviour had violated discipline. On the whole Friedrich II’s much-praised policy towards the farmers was ambiguous. On the one hand it was forbidden by law to add the farmers’ land to the domain, lucerne from England was imported in order to overcome the lack of feed, and the Landdragoner had to grow potatoes (the potato comes from the alto plano of Peru, now departemento Cochabamba, part of Bolivia since 1826); on the other hand the landed gentry was permanently privileged, thus the ‘lessitische Recht’ was kept in Upper Silesia – (meaning) it was not the family but the lord of the domain who inherited the farmer’s property. The King’s dislike of the Jews, however, never wavered. Jews were not allowed to have china, they were forbidden to take heavy hides abroad; if they disobeyed they were severely punished, and if they did it again they were sent to the fortifications in Magdeburg to do forced labour (the privilege for Marcus Pincus on the other hand demands that he must import heavy hides from abroad), the dairies established by Jews from Potsdam were forbidden, the Jews were forbidden to wander in or around the fortifications. There may have been reasons for this latter edict. The Jewish pedlars from Zülz and Hotzenplotz were fond of Austria because Karl VI had put an end to the Jews’ status as people without any rights with his edict of 11 February 1713 (or 13 February 1711) concerning taxes and tolerance although it meant high taxes (there were six tax schedules and the rabbis were put in the highest but one out of high esteem for Jewish science) – and they have possibly served Daun and Laudon as important spies In the Seven Years’ War . The Jews’ expulsion from Breslau with certain exceptions being laid down. A year later Maria Theresia copied his [Friedrich’s] example for Bohemia and Moravia and only thanks to the protests made by the ambassadors of both The Netherlands and Sweden in the name of humanity 70,000 Jews were allowed to return from the roads to their homes. (In our day Count Bernadotte (Sweden) and Juliana, Regent in The Netherlands, have followed the tradition of their countries. And already in 1670 the Dutch ambassador had pleaded with Leopold I to allow the Jews to stay in Wien , without success however. All 3,000 Jews left the town together with their chief rabbi Menachem Man, not even one was ready to be baptised, as the Brandenburg ambassador Andreas Neumann reported to the Great Elector . So in 1674 Brandenburg took in 50 well-off exiled families at the suggestion of that ambassador Andreas Neumann.) That the successor of Friedrich II, his nephew Friedrich Wilhelm II, had a positive attitude towards the Jews could be seen when he allowed artisans to accept young Jews already as apprentices while they were attending lessons in Protestant religious instruction to prepare them for their baptism (the regulations of the guilds allowed only Christians to work as craftsmen, with the exception of engravers). - 19 - [9]Beer was the proprietor of the Marcus Pincus leather factory, his heirs sold the land to Marcus Friedländer. [10]This man came from a different Friedländer family in Oppeln. His father had exploited the right of usufruct for mining ore on the right bank of the Oder and in his last will left to the synagogue community of Oppeln their first bequest of 300 Taler. [11]I have discovered that in the years 1812-15 93 persons in Brieg received the full rights of citizenship, thus it was number 3 in Silesia after Breslau (1,484), Glogau and Zülz (368). There followed the village of Staedel with 65, Beuthen in Silesia with 64, Gleiwitz with 54, Rybnik with 52, the village of Langendorf with 48 people with full rights of citizenship. In Oppeln 13, Krappitz 8, Proskau 9, various villages in the district of Oppeln 48 new citizens. [12]Pringsheim was a wartime volunteer, like all the Jews who took part in the ‘Freiheitskriegen’ – in comparison with the percentage of Jews in the population of the country the percentage of Jewish volunteers was higher. Conscription of Jews was introduced in Prussia as late as February 1817. In order to get the volunteers’ personal data for the rosters they used the ‘Mohel-books’ because Jewish births were registered only from 1812 on. In the forties there was the call for giving the Jews more rights – as had been promised in 1812. So the King sought the expert opinions of statesmen and generals. The war minister declared, ‘During the Wars of Liberation the Jews were as courageous as their Christian comrades.’ On the other hand Minister Schroeter said, ’The Jews are superior to the Christians by their diligence, their sobriety and by the way the families support their members, and so they cannot get the same rights as the Christians.’ This standpoint was accepted for the time being. [13]Dr Cohn was one of the first rabbis in Silesia who had also had a humanistic education. He had studied at the Marburg University and had enrolled for interpretation exercises in Arabic, for Assyrian and for Semitic philology with Professor Gildemeister. The pro-rector, the vice-chancellor and the authorised representative of the sovereign certified that he had conducted himself impeccably and had not joined one of the forbidden students’ unions. Dr Cohn later went to Schwerin where he was the head of the rabbis of both Mecklenburgs . (The Prussian law for Jews of 1812 was partly an imitation of the Mecklenburg law.) From there he went to Maastricht (Holland) as the provincial rabbi and during his last years he gave lectures on the Talmud at the Hildesheimer rabbi seminary. At about the same time as Oppeln Gleiwitz had also engaged a Dr Hirschfeld as their rabbi. This man later applied to the government in Darmstadt, who were the competent authority, for the position of the district rabbi; the Hessian government enquired of that in Oppeln ‘what had been Dr Hirschfeld’s academic career, which was his religious tendency and did he get on well with his community.’ The government answered in a way typical of the ‘Vormärz’ . ‘Dr Hirschfeld has some academic knowledge in his subject, has also tried his hand at writing and is absolutely blameless politically and has no police record.’ - 20 - [14]As it says in the deed of sale (of 1606; at that time the lord of the manor, the House of Habsburg, transferred the charter of the city to the Counts of Proskowski, who had been the pledge keepers so far and had always been benevolent towards the Jews) Zülz (district of Neustadt, Upper Silesia) had had Jews from times immemorial ‘auf dem Zieltz’ . The right of residence was owned by 120 ‘Bestandsjuden’ and by 43 servants of the community. Obviously they had fixed such a high number of servants because their number was not limited in the privilege (as in Berlin) so that as many brothers in faith as possible could get the right of residence. Among the servants there were rabbis, two assessors, a doctor, all kinds of artisans, two hospital attendants, six male nurses, four grave-diggers. Besides the financial contributions, breeding young dogs for their lords was also part of the Jews’ duties. In the Thirty Years War one Count of Poskrowski [sic], Oberlandeshauptmann of Silesia entreated the Swedish Generalissimo, ‘not to oppress his Jews too much’. [15]In Prussia the cabinet ministers had done the work of the government collectively, with the president as the ‘primus inter pares’ until Bismarck concentrated the whole power on the president in order to reduce the time for discussions – a forerunner of the ‘Führergedanke’ . [16]The government in Oppeln had worked out a model statute adapted to the law, which left enough scope for the special needs of each community, thus 3 – 7 chairmen, 1 – 2 deputy chairmen, 9 – 15 representatives, 2 – 3 deputy representatives, depending on their [the communities’] size. All Upper Silesian communities (more than 40) accepted this statute, only the community of Cosel with 41 tax-payers (two-thirds of the taxes were paid by a neighbouring owner of a manor) declared that they would not be able to fulfil their administrative tasks with three chairmen and one deputy chairman, nine representatives and two deputy representatives, so the government allowed them one extra deputy representative. [17]Autodidacts were also, among others, the two famous scholars, Heinrich Graetz from Krons (Posen), author and historian at the seminary of Jewish theology in Breslau, and Professor Berliner at the Hildesheimer rabbi seminary in Berlin, whose mnemonic techniques were obviously unattained and who was called ironically the scholar of Obersitzki by Treitschke . The Zwi-Graetz-Straße in Tel Aviv is named after Graetz. [18]The religious community Staedtel – all their members observed the sabbatical rest until the end – had been founded by the lord of the manor, a Duke of Wuerttemberg. In 1789 when he was in the Elsass with the army of the Empire, fighting against the Sansculotten , he fairly often played chess with the Jewish scholar Laqueur who lived there (the grandfather of Mrs Fanny Blumenfeld in Oppeln). To entice him to live near him when the peace treaty was concluded he built on some meadows belonging to the domain a rabbi’s house, a cantor’s house with a mikwa and 12 houses for Jews, which were immediately rented – the rent was to be 1 Reichstaler per month, and he appointed Laqueur to be the rabbi there. If now the Jews were short of fuel in February they started to take down the top layer - 21 - of the double shingle roof to use it as fuel since they knew very well that after Easter the ducal carpenter would restore it, paid for by the Duke. The ducal family proved also 80 years later that they were benevolent towards ‘their Jews’ for when the chairman, the farmer Ucko in the next village of Schwiertz, replaced the rotten wooden fence around the large cemetery on the hill with a massive wall the Ducal Brickworks in nearby Carlsruhe delivered the bricks at half the price, the Ducal Domain delivered the material free of charge, and the Lord and his wife contributed money to the wages. On about half the gravestones there is the name ‘Schuftan’, several times [you can find] the Upper Silesian Jewish names Ucko, Dura, Bial, Brinnitzer, Gurassa, Tockus, Goma, just once Laqueur and Coronna, the name of a family having immigrated from Italy. According to the legends of the village a very beautiful daughter of that family had gone to London to work as a servant and had married a duke. I am not prepared to swear an oath on the correctness of this information, namely that this union was registered. In June 1935 the last of these yearly commemoration ceremonies took place in the cemetery, which was attended by more than one hundred descendants of those buried there. District Rabbi Dr Wahrmann-Oels made the commemoration speech; representing the board of the union of the synagogue communities I outlined the history of this community. When there was the inaugural ceremony for the war memorial of the village, speeches were delivered by Rabbi Dr Braunschweiger of Oppeln and also by the clergy from there, a Catholic, a Lutheran and a Calvinist pastor. The superior of the latter was the Generalsuperintendent of Warschau – belief knows no frontiers, and the Reformation for this village must have come from Poland, where it had been preached by Calvin’s – not Luther’s – missionaries. [19]In 1854 the filial community of Krappitz consisted of 18 families with 63 people, among them only 13 male adults. Their chairman was one Loebel Rosenbach from Bayern . He and his son, who worked in Krappitz as a doctor, are buried in the cemetery which had been founded in 1816. The cantor must have received food free of charge from the families because his income was only 12 Taler per year while the whole budget was 58 Taler. [20]I had been given this permission from Dr Weigel, the chief executive officer responsible for educational and clerical authorities, who was a member of the Zentrum , (second vice-president of the last German Catholic Convention). He and the other councillors always showed understanding and goodwill when I – as often happened – had to advocate the wishes of the Upper Silesian communities. As soon as Hitler came to power Dr Weigel was demoted to the status of only a grammar school teacher and was later murdered in a concentration camp. This news was sent to Ossowski, who was the chief of the police in Oppeln during theWeimarRepublic and is now here in Cochabamba, by his party colleague, Minister Severing. One of the many cases for which I found the government’s - 22 - understanding was the following: the rabbi of Bromberg/Bydgoszcz which had become Polish had applied for the vacant position of our rabbi. I went to see the chief executive officer responsible for dealing with the registration of aliens in order to find out whether this man would perhaps be registered as foreigner. To the officer’s question: ‘What is the man’s reason for leaving there?’ I replied: ’Dr S studied in Wien , has a German cultural background and cannot feel happy in Poland.’ Then the officer declared, ‘I like him for that. You can be assured that his election will be confirmed. And as to your second question concerning his becoming a Prussian subject, of course I cannot put my successor under any obligation, but as a rule we usually grant citizenship if someone has behaved for two years free from reproach.’ Dr S was not elected because he was not able to come to Oppeln to deliver a test sermon and a service for the young ones and the bodies of the community could not do without those. [21]The members of the community were in this case ready to make the necessary sacrifices. For two years double the amount of community taxes were raised. The community and community unions sold their shares to partly pay the building costs of about 150,000 Marks, and of course they also used the money they had got for the sale of the Old Synagogue at the Mühlgraben. A sinking-fund mortgage loan of 120,000 Marks from the Preußische Zentral-Bodenkredit-Aktiengesellschaft made it possible for them to pay back the money borrowed for building the synagogue. [22]This synagogue community had asked permission in the middle of the previous century to issue shares in order to provide the means for building the new synagogue. The senior executive officer thought that this way was inappropriate; he said he would plead with the Provincial-Hilfsfonds for the community to get an amortisation credit on favourable conditions. He was successful. But this senior executive officer insisted that from then on the community council should also present the receipts of the Provincial-Hilfsfonds for the punctual payment of the interest and amortisation rates together with their yearly application for the approval of their budget. [23]The author of the text at hand was convinced that he, as the authorised representative of theReichsvertretung, had put these Sifré Torah (about 30) together with other Kle’ Kodach into safekeeping in the conference room of the synagogue. He had taken these things with him when the communities of Carlsruhe, Kreuzburg, Pitschen and Kronstadt were dissolved and intended to give them later to those who were going to emigrate overseas for synagogue communities already existing or still to be founded. The safe in the synagogue where the community’s silver equipment was kept had been broken open expertly, which allows the conclusion to be drawn that the silver utensils had been stolen before the arson attack, probably with the help of the caretaker of the synagogue. The fire brigade had ‘extinguished’ the fire with petrol. [24]These facts are given in a report from a former - 23 - cook of Mrs Lewinski (daughter of Samuel Gurassa), which she had sent to her daughter in Santiago de Chile. The descriptions of the destruction and the Polish character of the town were confirmed in identical words by a party comrade of Ossowski who is now here. generated an exception: Error code: 400 - {'error': {'message': \"This model's maximum context length is 8192 tokens, however you requested 10915 tokens (10915 in your prompt; 0 for the completion).
