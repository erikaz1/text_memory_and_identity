Primary RQ: 
To what extent has the history of people or individuals been preserved in our collective memory in a way that is at odds with individual recollection? 

I will predict whether the types of verbs and proper nouns in FW’s journals differ compared to those in news articles, interviews, and textbooks on FW. (Classification task.)

Data: 
- Personal Journals (https://willard.historyit.com/public-sites/featured-collection/transcripts?hsxezn=kezfcv)
- Modern, Digital Biographies (wiki, Britannica, PBS, Northwestern University)
- Interviews
- Speeches

Methods:


Four separate collections of documents representing the four sources of “recorded history” to compare. As for (a), (b), I can split my corpus into train and test portions. For ©, it might be interesting to look at a different historical figure and create a completely new corpus, and see if the model might apply (though the exact verbs and nouns will likely be different and need to be reidentified.)
(Exactly what each of these collections will contain is still under the works. I’m not sure if I will be able to collect all of this data by Friday, but definitely within the next few days.) 


Pitches will include one (potentially very) short paragraph describing your question(s); one short paragraph describing your "data" (e.g., texts, corpus, labels, etc.); and a final short paragraph describing the three methods you expect to use.
