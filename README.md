This project explores the perceived challenges faced by a student in recounting and recording the nature, behavior, history, and identity of both the individual and groups of people. The nuance of daily decisions and actions often get obscured when information is compressed into concise formats for communication. In this realm of collective human records, I investigate these ideas by comparing the types of information people share when reflecting on events in private, versus when sharing them with others. These explorations rely upon embeddings, discovered themes, and LLMs.

**Primary RQ: <br>**
- RQ1: How do Holocaust survivors articulate their lived experiences in personal interviews compared to scholarly interviews?
- RQ2: To what extent has the story of a famous individual been preserved in collective memory in ways that diverge from that individual's recollection, if at all?


**Data:** <br>
- Francis Willards' personal journals
- Digital archive pages collected from first two pages of google search results
- Holocaust survivor eyewitness testimonies
