**Primary RQ: <br>**
To what extent has the history of people or individuals been preserved in our collective memory in a way that is at odds with individual recollection? 

I will predict whether the types of verbs and proper nouns in FW’s journals differ compared to those in news articles, interviews, and textbooks on FW. (Classification task.)

**Why?**
Canonical sociological areas of study include: gender, race, income, and other identity-related fields. The US census, since its inception, as also forced the American People to think of themselves with regard to these categories. My general argument is that people, and women and minorities in particular, are more than their identities. It's time that we not only learn the long history behind identity-making, but also expand beyond these obvious borders. I want to prove, through the pictures that people paint of themselves in diaries and personal journals, that we are more than any of the labels we put onto ourselves. I want to demonstrate the multidimensionality and the potentiality of the individual in ways that have not been shown or made obvious before. (And sociologists don't tend to look at the individual, mostly extrapolating to group behavior, or the individual in relation to others.) 

**Data: **
- Personal Journals (https://willard.historyit.com/public-sites/featured-collection/transcripts?hsxezn=kezfcv)
- Modern, Digital Biographies (wiki, Britannica, PBS, Northwestern University)
- Interviews
- Speeches

**Methods:**


Four separate collections of documents representing the four sources of “recorded history” to compare. As for (a), (b), I can split my corpus into train and test portions. For ©, it might be interesting to look at a different historical figure and create a completely new corpus, and see if the model might apply (though the exact verbs and nouns will likely be different and need to be reidentified.)
(Exactly what each of these collections will contain is still under the works. I’m not sure if I will be able to collect all of this data by Friday, but definitely within the next few days.) 


Pitches will include one (potentially very) short paragraph describing your question(s); one short paragraph describing your "data" (e.g., texts, corpus, labels, etc.); and a final short paragraph describing the three methods you expect to use.
