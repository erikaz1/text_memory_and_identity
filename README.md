**Primary RQ: <br>**
**To what extent has the history of people or individuals been preserved in our collective memory in a way that is at odds with individual recollection?** What do the possible findings (discrepancy) mean? Is there a better way to remember and understand people as a society?

I will predict whether the types of verbs and proper nouns in FW’s journals differ compared to those in news articles, interviews, and textbooks on FW. (Classification task.)
<br>
**Why?** <br>
Canonical areas of identity studies in sociology include gender, race, income. The establishment of the U.S. census (roughly around the nation's inception), is one example of systemic influences that continue to allow the American people to think of themselves or those around them with regard to these categories. 

I argue that people, women and minorities in particular, are more than these identity categories, even though unifying under labels strengthens groups at times, and weakens them during others. While this argument is not new, the way that we label, remember, and discuss people reflects what we think is possible (for the individual/group) and who we think people are. 

I believe we must investigate how to expand beyond these obvious borders. Comparing the pictures that people paint of themselves in diaries and personal journals to biographies and digital archives, I seek to uncover, if existent, the multidimensionality and the potentiality of the individual in ways that have not been shown or made obvious before.

**Data:** <br>
- Personal Journals (https://willard.historyit.com/public-sites/featured-collection/transcripts?hsxezn=kezfcv)
- Google search, front page (wiki, Britannica, PBS, Northwestern University)
- Interviews 
- Biography (maybe)
- Speeches (collected but maybe will leave out)
<br>
**Methods:** <br>
Four separate collections of documents representing the four sources of “recorded history” to compare. As for (a), (b), I can split my corpus into train and test portions. For ©, it might be interesting to look at a different historical figure and create a completely new corpus, and see if the model might apply (though the exact verbs and nouns will likely be different and need to be reidentified.)
(Exactly what each of these collections will contain is still under the works. I’m not sure if I will be able to collect all of this data by Friday, but definitely within the next few days.) 


one short paragraph describing your "data" (e.g., texts, corpus, labels, etc.); and a final short paragraph describing the three methods you expect to use.
