**Primary RQ: <br>**
To what extent has the history of people or individuals been preserved in our collective memory in a way that is at odds with individual recollection?
- What do the possible findings (discrepancy) mean?
- Is there a better way to remember and understand people as a society?
<br>

**Data:** <br>
Person Alignment
- Personal Journals (https://willard.historyit.com/public-sites/featured-collection/transcripts?hsxezn=kezfcv)
- Google search, front page (wiki, Britannica, PBS, Northwestern University)
- Interviews 
- Biography (maybe)
- Speeches (collected but maybe will leave out)<br>

Dimensions of analysis
- Qualitative coding of thoughts (https://delibdemjournal.org/article/331/galley/4742/view/)
- Opinion vs. fact; Presentation as opinion vs. fact 
<br>

**Methods:** <br>
1. Firstly, I would like to create semantic dimensions from embeddings and project different groups of word vectors into these dimensions in order to uncover whether the meanings of important concepts are different for FW compared to historical recollection. We expect to see more divergence on topics related to FW's social life (for instance), and more uniformity on topics related to her legacy and public persona. It will also be possible to plot linguistic change through FW's journals.
2. Secondly, I would like to analyze the types of thoughts captured through text. Stromer-Galley (2007) proposes a coding scheme to "measure deliberation" by grouping thoughts as: problem, metatalk, process, or social. I add a fifth dimension "reputation". I hypothesize that sources like Wikipedia tend to focus on reputation and process-based ideas, whereas a more complete and engaging picture is one that involves a little bit of everything: problem, meta, process, and social.  
3. Lastly, I'm interested in potentially using LLMs to model interactions.

**Why?** <br>
Canonical areas of identity studies in sociology include gender, race, income. The establishment of the U.S. census (roughly around the nation's inception), is one example of systemic influences that continue to allow the American people to think of themselves or those around them with regard to these categories. 

I argue that people, women and minorities in particular, are more than these identity categories, even though unifying under labels strengthens groups at times, and weakens them during others. While this argument is not new, the way that we label, remember, and discuss people reflects what we think is possible (for the individual/group) and who we think people are. 

I believe we must investigate how to expand beyond these obvious borders. Comparing the pictures that people paint of themselves in diaries and personal journals to biographies and digital archives, I seek to uncover, if existent, the multidimensionality and the potentiality of the individual in ways that have not been shown or made obvious before. 

I will start my investigation with the American **Frances Willard** (1839-1898) and add other figures to my corpus later, time permitting.
